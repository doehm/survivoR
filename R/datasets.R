#' }
#' @details This data frame contains a complete history of votes cast across all seasons of Survivor. While there are consistent
#' events across the seasons there are some unique events such as the 'mutiny' in Survivor: Cook Islands (season 13)
#' or the 'Outcasts' in Survivor: Pearl Islands (season 7). For maintaining a standard, whenever there has been a change
#' in tribe for the castaways it has been recorded as \code{swapped}. \code{swapped} is used as the
#' term since 'the tribe swap' is a typical recurring milestone in each season of Survivor. Subsequent changes are recorded with
#' a trailing digit e.g. \code{swapped2}. This includes absorbed tribes e.g. Stephanie was 'absorbed'
#' in Survivor: Palau (season 10) and when 3 tribes are
#' reduced to 2. These cases are still considered 'swapped' to indicate a change in tribe status.
#'
#' Some events result in a castaway attending tribal but not voting. These are recorded as
#' \describe{
#'   \item{\code{Win}}{The castaway won the fire challenge}
#'   \item{\code{Lose}}{The castaway lost the fire challenge}
#'   \item{\code{None}}{The castaway did not cast a vote. This may be due to a vote steal or some other means}
#'   \item{\code{Immune}}{The castaway did not vote but were immune from the vote}
#' }
#'
#' Where a castaway has \code{immunity == 'hidden'} this means that player is protected by a hidden immunity idol. It may not
#' necessarily mean they played the idol, the idol may have been played for them. While the nullified votes data is complete
#' the \code{immunity} data does not include those who had immunity but did not receive a vote. This is a TODO.
#'
#' In the case where the 'steal a vote' advantage was played, there is a second row for the castaway that stole the vote.
#' The castaway who had their vote stolen are is recorded as \code{None}.
#'
#' Many castaways have been medically evacuated, quit or left the game for some other reason. In these cases where no votes
#' were cast there is a skip in the \code{order} variable. Since no votes were cast there is nothing to record on this
#' data frame. The correct order in which castaways departed the island is recorded on \code{castaways}.
#'
#' In the case of a tie, \code{voted_out} is recorded as \code{tie} to indicate no one was voted off the island in that
#' instance. The re-vote is recorded with \code{vote_order = 2} to indicate this is the second round of voting. In
#' the case of a second tie \code{voted_out} is recorded as \code{tie2}. The third step is either a draw of rocks,
#' fire challenge or countback (in the early days of survivor). In these cases \code{vote} is recorded as the colour of the
#' rock drawn, result of the fire challenge or 'countback'.

#' @details This data set contains the name, description, and descriptive features for each
#' challenge where it is known. Challenges can go by different names so have included the
#' unique name and the recurring challenge name. These are taken directly from the
#' [Survivor Wiki](https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Recurring_Challenges).
#' Sometimes there can be variations made on the challenge but go but the same name, or
#' the challenge is integrated with a longer obstacle. In these cases the challenge may
#' share the same recurring challenge name but have a different challenge name. Even if
#' they share the same names the description could be different.
#'
#' The features of each challenge have been determined largely through string searches
#' of key words that describe the challenge. It may not be 100% accurate due to the
#' different and inconsistent descriptions but in most part they will provide a good
#' basis for analysis.
#'
#' If any descriptive features need altering please let me know in the

#' Tribe mapping

#'   are missing values where players have returned to the game. This means there are multiple stages of the game where there is a different
#'   make up of the final 8, for example. This field just takes the last set so that you can filter for `final_n` and it will return a
#'   single set of castaways.}
#'   \item{\code{n_boots}}{Similar to `final_n` but the number of boots in the game. This is different to `order` where order counts if

#' Confessionals
#'
#' A dataset containing the count of confessionals per castaway per episode. A confessional is when
#' the castaway is speaking directly to the camera about their game.

#' @format This data frame contains the following columns:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{\code{version}}{Country code for the version of the show}

#'   \item{\code{index_count}}{The index based on the confessional counts. See details.}
#'   \item{\code{index_time}}{The index based on the confessional time. See details.}
#' }
#'
#' @details Confessional data has been counted by contributors of the survivoR R package and consolidated
#' with external sources. The aim is to establish consistency in confessional counts in the absence of official
#' sources. Given the subjective nature of the counts and the potential for clerical error no single source is
#' more valid than another. Therefore, it is reasonable to average across all sources.
#'
#' In the case of double or extended episodes, if the episode only has one title it is considered a single episode. This
#' means the average number of confessionals per person is likely to be higher for this episode given it's length. If
#' there are two episode titles the confessionals are counted for the appropriate episode. This is to ensure consistency
#' across all other datasets.
#'
#' In the case of recap episodes, this episode is left blank.
#'
#' The indexes are a measure of how many more confessional counts or time the castaway has received given the point in the game.
#' For example a `index_count` of 1 implies the castaway has received the expected number of confessionals given equal share within tribe.
#' An index of 1.5 implies have have received 50% more. The measure is standardised within tribe since the tribe that goes to tribal
#' typically receives more confessionals for the episode. Makes sense. `index_time` is the same but using time instead of counts.
#'
#' If you also count confessionals, please get in touch and I'll add them into the package.

#'    \item MTCNN detects the human faces within each frame
#'    \item VGGFace2 converts each detected face into a 512d vector space
#'    \item A training set of labelled images (1 for each contestant + 3 for
#'    Jeff Probst) is processed in the same way to determine where they sit in
#'    the vector space.
#'    TODO: This could be made more accurate by increasing the number of training
#'    images per contestant.
#'    \item The Euclidean distance is calculated for the faces detected in the frame
#'    to each of the contestants in the season (+Jeff). If the minimum distance is
#'    greater than 1.2 the face is labelled as "unknown".
#'    TODO: Review how robust this distance cutoff truly is - currently based on
#'    manual review of Season 42.
#'    \item A multi-class SVM is trained on the training set to label faces. For
#'    any face not identified as "unknown", the vector embedding is run into this
#'    model and a label is generated.
#'    \item All labelled faces are aggregated together, with an assumption of 1
#'    full second of screen time each time a face is seen.
