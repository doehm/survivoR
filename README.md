<strong>Castaways</strong>
</summary>

## Castaways

This data set contains season and demographic information about each
castaway. It is structured to view their results for each season.
Castaways that have played in multiple seasons will feature more than
once with the age and location representing that point in time.
Castaways that re-entered the game will feature more than once in the
same season as they technically have more than one boot order
e.g.¬†Natalie Anderson - Winners at War.

Each castaway has a unique `castaway_id` which links the individual
across all data sets and seasons. It also links to the following ID‚Äôs
found on the `vote_history`, `jury_votes` and `challenges` data sets.

- `vote_id`
- `voted_out_id`
- `finalist_id`

## Castaway details

A few castaways have changed their name from season to season or have
been referred to by a different name during the season e.g.¬†Amber
Mariano; in season 8 Survivor All-Stars there was Rob C and Rob M. That
information has been retained here in the `castaways` data set.

`castaway_details` contains unique information for each castaway. It
takes the full name from their most current season and their most
verbose short name which is handy for labelling.

It also includes gender, date of birth, occupation, race, ethnicity and
other data. If no source was found to determine a castaways race and
ethnicity, the data is kept as missing rather than making an assumption.

Race, ethnicity, and POC data isonly complete for US. `poc` has been
simplified to be ‚ÄúPOC‚Äù for where a player has a field for `race` and/or
`ethnicity` for US players as per (Survivor
wiki)\[<https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki>\]. All others have been left
blank rather than making assumptions.

<strong>Vote history</strong>
</summary>

## Vote history

This data frame contains a complete history of votes cast across all
seasons of Survivor. This allows you to see who who voted for who at
which Tribal Council. It also includes details on who had individual
immunity as well as who had their votes nullified by a hidden immunity
idol. This details the key events for the season.

There is some information on split votes to help calculate if a player
engaged in a split vote but ultimately hit their target. There are
events which influence the vote e.g.¬†Extra votes, safety without power,
etc. These are recorded here as well.

## Challenge results

Note: From v1.1 the `challenge_results` dataset has been improved but
could break existing code. The old table is maintained at
`challenge_results_dep`

There are two tables `challenge_results` and `challenge_description`.

### Challenge results

A tidy data frame of immunity and reward challenge results. The winners

The `challenge_id` is the primary key for the `challenge_description`
data set. The `challange_id` will change as the data or descriptions
change.

## Challenge description

*Note: This data frame is going through a massive revamp. Stay tuned.*

This data set contains descriptive binary fields for each challenge.
Challenges can go by different names but where possible recurring
challenges are kept consistent. While there are tweaks to the
challenges, where the main components of the challenge is consistent,
they share the same name.

The features of each challenge have been determined largely through
string searches of key words that describe the challenge. It may not
capture the full essence of the challenge but on the whole will provide
a good basis for analysis. Since the description is simply a short
paragraph or sentence it may not flag all appropriate features. If any
descriptive features need altering please let me know in the
[issues](https://github.com/doehm/survivoR/issues).

Features:

- `puzzle`: If the challenge contains a puzzle element.
- `race`: If the challenge is a race between tribes, teams or
  individuals.
- `precision`: If the challenge contains a precision element
  e.g.¬†shooting an arrow, hitting a target, etc.
- `endurance`: If the challenge is an endurance event e.g.¬†last tribe,
  team, individual standing.
- `strength`: If the challenge is largely strength based e.g.¬†Shoulder
  the Load.
- `turn_based`: If the challenge is conducted in a series of rounds
  until a certain amount of points are scored or there is one player
  remaining.
- `balance`: If the challenge contains a balancing element.
- `food`: If the challenge contains a food element e.g.¬†the food
  challenge, biting off chunks of meat.
- `knowledge`: If the challenge contains a knowledge component e.g.¬†Q
  and A about the location.
- `memory`: If the challenge contains a memory element e.g.¬†memorising a
  sequence of items.
- `fire`: If the challenge contains an element of fire making /
  maintaining.
- `water`: If the challenge is held, in part, in the water.

History of jury votes. It is more verbose than it needs to be, however
having a 0-1 column indicating if a vote was placed or not makes it
easier to summarise castaways that received no votes.

seasons. It details where it was found, if there was a clue to the
advantage, location and other advantage conditions. This maps to the

## Advantage Movement

The `advantage_movement` table tracks who found the advantage, who they
may have handed it to and who the played it for. Each step is called an
event. The `sequence_id` tracks the logical step of the advantage. For
example in season 41, JD found an Extra Vote advantage. JD gave it to
Shan in good faith who then voted him out keeping the Extra Vote. Shan
gave it to Ricard in good faith who eventually gave it back before Shan
played it for Naseer. That movement is recorded in this table.

<strong>Confessionals</strong>
</summary>

## Confessionals

A dataset containing the number of confessionals for each castaway by
season and episode. There are multiple contributors to this data. Where
there are multiple sets of counts for a season the average is taken and
added to the package. The aim is to establish consistency in
confessional counts in the absence of official sources. Given the
subjective nature of the counts and the potential for clerical error no
single source is more valid than another. So it is reasonable to average
across all sources.

Confessional time exists for a few seasons. This is the total cumulative
time for each castaway in seconds. This is a much more accurate
indicator of the ‚Äòedit‚Äô.

``` r
confessionals |> 
  filter(season == 45) |> 
  group_by(castaway) |> 
  summarise(
    count = sum(confessional_count),
    time = sum(confessional_time)
    )
#> # A tibble: 18 √ó 3
#>    castaway count  time
#>    <chr>    <dbl> <dbl>

#>  5 Dee         67  1102

#> 16 Sabiyah     22   342
#> 17 Sean        16   325
#> 18 Sifu        11   236
```

The confessional index is available on this data set. The index is a
standardised measure of the number of confessionals the player has
received compared to the others. It is stratified by tribe so it
measures how many confessionals each player gets proportional to even
share within tribe e.g.¬†an index of 1.5 means that player as received
50% more than others in their tribe.

The tribe grouping is important since the tribe that attends tribal
council typical get more screen time, which is fair enough. I don‚Äôt
think we should expect even share across everyone in the pre-merge stage
of the game.

The index is cumulative with episode, so the players final index is the
index in their final episode.

<strong>Screen time</strong>
</summary>

## Screen time \[EXPERIMENTAL\]

This dataset contains the estimated screen time for each castaway during
an episode. Please note that this is still in the early days of
development. There is likely to be misclassifcation and other sources of
error. The model will be refined over time.

An individuals‚Äô screen time is calculated, at a high-level, via the
following process:

1.  Frames are sampled from episodes on a 1 second time interval

2.  MTCNN detects the human faces within each frame

3.  VGGFace2 converts each detected face into a 512d vector space

4.  A training set of labelled images (1 for each contestant + 3 for
    Jeff Probst) is processed in the same way to determine where they
    sit in the vector space. TODO: This could be made more accurate by
    increasing the number of training images per contestant.

5.  The Euclidean distance is calculated for the faces detected in the
    frame to each of the contestants in the season (+Jeff). If the
    minimum distance is greater than 1.2 the face is labelled as
    ‚Äúunknown‚Äù. TODO: Review how robust this distance cutoff truly is -
    currently based on manual review of Season 42.

6.  A multi-class SVM is trained on the training set to label faces. For
    any face not identified as ‚Äúunknown‚Äù, the vector embedding is run
    into this model and a label is generated.

7.  All labelled faces are aggregated together, with an assumption of
    1-5 full second of screen time each time a face is seen and
    factoring in time between detection capping at a max of 5 seconds.

There are 2 data sets, `survivor_acution` and `auction_details`.
`survivor_auction` simply shows who attended the auction and

# Issues

Given the variable nature of the game of Survivor and changing of the
rules, there are bound to be edges cases where the data is not quite
right. Before logging an issue please install the git version to see if
it has already been corrected. If not, please log an issue and I will
correct the datasets.

New features will be added, such as details on exiled castaways across
the seasons. If you have a request for specific data let me know in the
issues and I‚Äôll see what I can do. Also, if you‚Äôd like to contribute by
adding to existing datasets or contribute a new dataset, please [contact
me directly](http://gradientdescending.com/contact/).

# Showcase

## Survivor Dashboard

[**Carly Levitz**](https://twitter.com/carlylevitz) has developed a
fantastic
[dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/carly.levitz/viz/SurvivorCBSData-Acknowledgements/Tableofcontents)
showcasing the data and allowing you to drill down into seasons,
castaways, voting history and challenges.
