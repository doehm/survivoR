Upon arrival, the Pagong tribe celebrated the beginning of this journey while the Tagi tribe got right to work with Rudy taking command, aggravating some of his tribe members. Richard called for order and structure, to which Susan agreed. Ultimately, they pulled together to assemble a functional camp. At Pagong, B.B. stepped into the leadership role. He and Ramona found the tribe's watering hole, and jokingly agreed to hide it from the group. The next morning, Tagi seemed to be in good spirits as Sonja played her ukulele, though Rudy realized he might need to adapt to the personalities of his younger tribemates. B.B.'s aggressive work ethic grated on Pagong and his tribe's laziness began to frustrate him.\n\nReward/immunity challenge: The tribes were tasked with guiding a lit raft through shallow water. Upon reaching the shore, the competitors must carry the raft above land to the finish line. Along the way were a number of torches that must be lit with the raft's fire, culminating in a final fire bowl in front of a massive bamboo statute that must be set ablaze. The first tribe to light their final bowl won immunity and a reward of waterproof matches.At the first immunity challenge, Tagi took the early lead by guiding its raft through the water. Sonja stumbled as they reached the shore, helping Pagong crawl ahead to light their final torch and win. As a result, Pagong received matches and immunity from that night's Tribal Council. At Tagi's camp, Richard and Rudy bonded while Sean tended to Sonja's injuries. As the first vote approached, Stacey talked of voting out Rudy for being overbearing, but at Tribal Council, a plurality of the tribe instead decided to vote out their choice of weakest link, Sonja."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US01","season_name":"Survivor: Borneo","season":1,"episode_number_overall":2,"episode":2,"episode_title":"The Generation Gap","episode_label":"Ep 2","episode_date":"2000-06-07","episode_length":44,"viewers":18100000,"imdb_rating":7.4,"n_ratings":238,"episode_summary":"Following their Tribal Council, Tagi found its fish traps still empty. Disappointed that Rudy was not voted out, Stacey suggested he was not made for the game, while Rudy believed Stacey wasn't cut out for wilderness survival. Richard revealed to his tribe that he is gay, making Dirk uncomfortable. It didn't discourage Rudy, who still saw Richard as a strong competitor. At Pagong, Ramona was dehydrated and ill while B.B. refused to quit working. Greg and Colleen began to grow close. Greg's evening game showed tribe spirits were high, though B.B. continued to annoy his tribe by washing his clothes in drinking water. At Tagi, Sean crafted a fishing pole to catch food for the group. Both tribes received tree mail, foretelling a disgusting competition. B.B. suggested Pagong throw the challenge to eliminate him, but the tribe refused.\n\nImmunity challenge: One by one, each castaway was given an insect grub to consume. If any individual refused to eat their bug, their tribe would lose the challenge. The tiebreaker saw one member of each tribe (chosen by the opposing tribe) racing to eat two larvae, with the first player to complete the task winning immunity for their tribe.Ultimately, despite Gervase's struggles, everyone was able to eat their assigned grub, forcing each tribe to select one person from the opposite group to eat two bugs in a tiebreaker face-off.

Greg appeared to be providing light relief to their tribe, and Gretchen said this would likely get him further in the game. At Tagi, Sean and Dirk spent most of their time fishing, but had no luck; Sean also tried to build a bowling alley. Kelly, Susan, and Richard created an alliance.\n\nReward challenge: The castaways had to make a distress signal. The goal was to make the best S.O.S. signal for the plane (with Jeff in it) to see. The best signal would win the tribe hammocks, towels and pillows, plus two additional items (one chosen by each tribe; Tagi chose a flaying knife, Pagong chose a spice rack). Tagi won the challenge.Immunity challenge: A five-part relay race: The first member swam to a buoy, dove down and retrieved a map in a bottle. The second ran across a floating bridge with the bottle to a waiting boat, where the second and third paddled to shore. The fourth member would break the bottle, check the map, and sprint into the jungle to find a rope ladder and a key. For the final leg, the two remaining tribe members had to locate a buried treasure chest and dig it up. Tagi, being the first tribe to unearth their treasure chest and bring it back to the start line and have the key inside the lock, were the winners.At the immunity challenge, Gervase had problems on the sprint into the jungle, one of the main reasons Pagong lost to Tagi again.

Greg and Colleen grew closer, choosing to sleep out in the jungle away from the others. Greg knew he was becoming somewhat of a tribe leader, a role he didn't want.\n\nReward challenge: Tribes selected three tribe members to shoot for the tribe in three rounds. The first one was a blow gun, the second was a slingshot, and the third was a spear toss. The winning tribe would win fruit and chickens.At the reward challenge, Joel helped Pagong win with his spear throwing after the first two rounds were tied. Dirk and Sean began to help around the camp but that didn't change their tribe members' minds, and they remained on the outs.

Gervase offended the girls by telling them that they were dumber than a cow. One of Pagong's chickens was eaten by another creature. At Tagi, Richard began walking around camp naked.\n\nReward challenge: One at a time, each tribe member raced to a barrack. There were three different items in there (a can opener, a knife, and an Army helmet). The first tribe to get all of their items (with no duplicates) back to the start won a reward of canned foods and a chocolate bar.At the reward challenge, Richard brought back a duplicate knife instead of a can opener and Pagong won by default. At Pagong, Joel tried to create an alliance with the group that would carry over after the merge but was shot down by the women of the tribe.

The next day, Jenna and Sean decided to live at the Tagi beach and named their merged tribe Rattana. The ten castaways met up and everyone celebrated, except Rudy, who was annoyed because the population doubled.\n\nImmunity challenge: All ten castaways submerged themselves underwater to see how long they could hold their breath.

Greg went first and no one hit the mark closer, so he won the reward and saw his home video from his sister and sent one back to her. Rudy thought there might be some incestuous behavior between Greg and his sister though clearly took things the wrong way. Jenna was frustrated about losing the reward challenge and instead of watching Greg's video, continued to practice with the bow and arrow, continually hitting the target closer than Greg's mark.

Sean was convinced that his alphabet strategy of voting for people was the fairest way and that there was no alliance because he wasn't asked to be a part of it.

The person who lasted the longest would win immunity.After two hours of holding on the idol, Jeff tempted the three with oranges. After 2½ hours, Richard gave a speech, said he wouldn't be able to outlast Kelly, and stepped down voluntarily. He said that it was a game of odds and he didn't know what the winner would actually do. After three hours, the remaining two switched positions while keeping their hand on the idol and were to do so every half-hour. While the two were still standing on the pole, Richard spoke of the alliance to Jeff and how he wasn't surprised that Kelly changed her vote. After 4 hours, 11 minutes, Rudy took his hand off the idol while switching spots, and Kelly won immunity yet again. Richard and Rudy each said it was in Kelly's best interest to keep them. At Tribal Council, Kelly voted out Rudy because she thought she might have a better chance of winning defeating Richard than Rudy.\nAt the final Tribal Council, Gervase asked if there were one, two or three things they would change about their time on the island if anything at all. Richard said trusting people so easily, Kelly said making an alliance. Jenna asked who they would put in the final two and why. Richard said Rudy and Greg; Kelly said Sonja and Gretchen. Sean had no questions, but congratulated the two and thanked Kelly for being capable and keeping camp afloat, and told Richard that he enjoyed his company although he played the game differently. Colleen asked what three character traits got them where they were and were essential to get future players to the finals; Kelly said faith, strong will, and likability, while Richard said self-awareness, observation of relationships, and ethics. Rudy said he had nothing to say to those two, but felt dumb after mistakenly removing his hand in the final immunity challenge. Greg had them choose a number between 1 and 10 (Rich said 7; Kelly 3). Susan famously compared Richard to a snake and Kelly to a rat, and declared her intent to vote for Richard. In the end, Rudy, Susan, Sean, and Greg voted for Richard; Jenna, Gervase, and Colleen voted for Kelly.

They were divided into two tribes of eight: Maraamu (Tahitian for wind) wearing yellow, and Rotu (Tahitian for rain) wearing blue, and had to paddle two miles to their beaches. Due to the extreme current, the Rotu tribe was making no progress, but by rowing together they started to move. Maraamu noticed that Sarah was not giving an effort into helping row to the beach. After landing on the beach, Sean and Peter had a prayer session out in the water, and Rob M. thought \"they either started playing the game as soon as possible, or they were off their rocker.\"\nRotu tried using their magnifying glass to start a fire, but it was too cloudy to get direct sunlight. They then tried starting a fire with friction, which also didn’t work. As soon as Kathy walked away, some of the tribe voiced their annoyance with her. Hunter look the leadership role at Maraamu, and they got much smoke, and thanks to Peter’s long breaths, they finally got a fire. At night, Rob M. and Sarah’s flirtations had the rest of the tribe talking.\nRotu found a waterfall near their camp, and also found much taro to eat. Maraamu found some grapefruit trees. Rob M. heard a rooster crowing at camp, and went on a wild chase, but it flew away. Hunter thought Rob M. was wasting his time and needed to work on other chores. Back at Rotu, John argued with Kathy about the fire situation, but he felt bad afterward so wanted to start the fire for her, which he and Zoe did. Maraamu found their water source, and Peter thought he was working too hard, so he decided to take a break.\n\nImmunity challenge: Each tribe has an outrigger canoe with two torches. The teams must run down the beach with it and then swim with it out to a wok where they must light both torches, then come back to the beach, lighting four torches along the way. Once they get back to shore, they must sprint along the shore, lighting three more torches, get the canoe back in its stand, and light the final torch.The immunity challenge proved tough. Maraamu was first to the center wok, but had issues lighting their torches, and Rotu took the lead. Things got worse as they dropped one of the torches in the water. Rotu won immunity fairly handily.\nPeter wanted to keep the tribe as strong as possible, and Gina said she was going to vote the way she wanted to vote and that no one would talk her into voting a certain way. Some of the women thought that Peter was strange. Sean thought the more males on the tribe, the better, and he wanted to vote out Sarah. Going into the first tribal council, there were no clear alliances, and a lot of people had no idea who they were voting for.

Rob was also struggling physically due to the lack of food. Some of the males made traps and fishing gear to try and catch some protein. At Maraamu, Hunter, Rob M. and Sean’s morning show was entertaining the tribe, and put them in high spirits. Patricia, or \"Momma\" as she was nicknamed by the tribe, stepped up around camp. John wanted to be as high as possible on the pecking order, and caught a shrimp with the trap that he made. Almost immediately after, Kathy called the tribe over as she found a trove of shells and crabs. Back at Maraamu, Patricia’s hard work turned into bossiness, which rubbed some people the wrong way. Sean and Vecepia bonded over their culture and love for God. Although Sean looked physically strong, Gina and Hunter noted his laziness around camp. They also noticed that Rob M. and Sarah were spending a lot of time together, and Hunter thought that if Sarah were to go, they could get more productivity out of Rob M. Again back at Rotu, Kathy wanted to have a meeting about the shelter because there wasn’t enough room for everyone. Gabriel fought back a little, saying that she wasn’t putting forth the effort to get to know everyone. Still, they redid their shelter to include everyone.\n\nReward challenge: Each tribe has a boat anchored at the bottom of the ocean floor with about 250 rocks inside. They must dive down and remove as many rocks as possible until the boat floats to the surface. Then, they must bail enough water as they determine necessary and paddle to the beach. The winning tribe receives fishing gear: mask, snorkel, and fins.While Maraamu only sent down one or two people at a time, Rotu went down in groups. They finally sent a group down to flip the boat instead; it worked and rose to the surface. Maraamu followed suit, rising their boat to the surface. While Rotu flipped their boat on their dock, Maraamu flipped it in the water and had to bail water out. That gave Rotu the advantage, and they ran their boat to their mat, giving them their second straight win.\nBack at Maraamu, Sarah voiced her opinions about the shelter, but no one wanted to listen to her because she wasn’t willing to put in the effort to do it herself.\n\nImmunity challenge: One at a time, each tribe member must bob for a piece of fafaru (marinated fish bones, crab and lobster legs) and eat it without throwing up.After 8 rounds, every person had eaten their piece, each tribe had to select a member of the other tribe to do the tiebreaker. Rotu chose Rob M. and Maraamu chose Neleh to do the tiebreaker. While both had problems, Rob M. threw part of his up and Neleh got hers down first, giving Rotu another win.\nAt tribal council, Sarah admitted she did less work in order to conserve energy at the challenges, to which Gina responded that if she has to pick up people’s slack at camp, she is twice as tired at the challenges. Although Sarah received three votes, an early alliance was formed as Vecepia, Sean, Rob M., and Sarah voted out Patricia due to her overall bossiness and per their alliance."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US04","season_name":"Survivor: Marquesas","season":4,"episode_number_overall":45,"episode":3,"episode_title":"No Pain, No Gain","episode_label":"Ep 3","episode_date":"2002-03-13","episode_length":43,"viewers":20460000,"imdb_rating":7.7,"n_ratings":125,"episode_summary":"After Maraamu’s vote, Sarah got upset about people saying she didn’t do work around camp, and an argument broke out.

He became the father figure around camp. John landed on a sea urchin and needed someone to pee on his hand, which Kathy did. The Maraamu members were having big issues with the nonos, which were biting them horribly. While moving the bamboo poles for their raft up to camp, Robert stepped on a rock and sliced the bottom of his big toe open, which John took care of. Later on, John got bitten by an eel while looking for food, which gave him a deep cut on one of his fingers.\n\nReward challenge: Each tribe has to construct a raft from bamboo and rope that can fit 6 members and other supplies.

The Maraamu tribe decided to go for a hike and eventually got lost; Kathy wanted to go further while some of the tribe wanted to head back. They found a pool with shrimp in it. While the rest of the tribe stayed to try and catch some shrimp, Sarah wanted to head back to avoid being bitten by the nonos. However, she got herself lost and headed back to where the rest of her tribe was. Back at Rotu, Sean grew tired of working so much around camp and complained about it to Gabriel. Rob asked Vecepia what she thought about everything, and she said she wanted to stay out of the drama as much as possible.\n\nImmunity challenge: Each tribe has to unscramble a woven tapestry.Rotu got off to a fast start, while Maraamu struggled. Kathy was the only one offering directions, while Gabriel and Vecepia led the way for Rotu. Rotu easily won their fourth straight immunity, but this is the first time Rob, Sean, and Vecepia won while this is the first time Kathy, Neleh, and Paschal lost.\nGina told Kathy, Neleh, and Paschal she wanted Sarah out because of her weakness in challenges and her laziness around camp. Meanwhile, Sarah was oblivious to her tribemates wanting her out and believed that it was everyone for themselves.

He thought that Sean would definitely be the first to go, followed by a tossup between himself and Vecepia, so he tried to get himself in further with the original Rotu members to further himself. Gabriel said he was not there to play the game, but for the experience, which bothered John. At Maraamu, they found tons of crabs and were able to make an entire pan full of crab meat.\n\nReward challenge: Fourteen pieces belonging to four tikis are scattered on a course. One member will guide three blindfolded members to the fourteen pieces. Once all pieces are back, the four tikis must be reconstructed. The winning tribe gets to raid the losing tribe’s camp.At the reward challenge, Gabriel and Kathy were chosen as the eyes for their tribe. Rotu took an early lead and had 13 pieces, but could not find the last piece. Maraamu made up the difference and collected all their pieces first. Rotu eventually found their last piece, but Maraamu was too far ahead. Maraamu won by a landslide, giving the tribe, and Gina, their first win. They had two minutes to raid Rotu's camp, and nearly every reward item Rotu had won ended up with Maraamu.\nJohn noticed Gabriel bonding with the three original Maraamu members. When he approached him about his voting strategy. When Gabriel said he didn’t have one and that he would only tell John who he was voting for beforehand, John did not feel comfortable and said that Gabe was no longer safe, and that he wanted to get rid of him. John concocted an alliance of himself, Robert, Zoe, and Tammy. In order to avoid a tie, John approached Sean about voting for Gabe as well.\n\nImmunity challenge: Each tribe must build a distress signal without using fire to signal a ship from a distance.Maraamu’s raid proved useful as they used a lot of the supplies taken from Rotu to help their signal. Rotu quickly realized that all three of the former Maraamu members were participating in the challenge, which worried Robert. Rotu built a signal with their raft and their life jackets, but the captain said he didn’t think it was a very good signal. Maraamu used the insides and outsides of their life-jackets, Paschal's American flag, and their white blankets to create moving signals. The captain said that Maraamu’s distress signal was much more obvious, and Maraamu won their second challenge and their first immunity.\nJohn continued to talk to the other members of Maraamu to get rid of Gabriel, but Rob had other plans and considered getting rid of John. After talking to Rob, Gabriel weighed his options of continuing to play his game or by joining forces. John worried that he may have hatched his plan too early and thought he may be going home. However, Gabriel’s apathetic attitude toward playing the game cost him and he was unanimously voted out.

The first runner races through the jungle, unties a paddle, and tags the second runner. Both then race to untie a second paddle, and then race back to the beach where they break open coconuts to find a key. The two runners pass the paddles and the key to two other tribe members, who must unchain a boat, paddle the boat out to retrieve a flag, then paddle back to plant their flag in the tiki. When the paddlers return to shore, they must push their boat to their chain and both paddlers must be present at the tiki when they put their flag in. The winning tribe receives a meal of chicken, quiche, bean salad, dessert, and Sierra Mist.At the reward challenge, the Maraamu tribe is shocked to see that Gabriel was voted out.

However, John and Robert manage to catch up as the boats are heading back. Gina and Kathy forget to take their flag as they ran to the finish, allowing John and Robert to put their flag in the tiki first. Jeff announced that Rotu won the challenge; but Maraamu protests, claiming Robert was not at the tiki before Gina and Kathy put their flag in after John. Jeff then goes to the boats to see if they were in reach of their chains. Maraamu's boat was okay, but Rotu placed their boat too far from their chain. Jeff then stated the Maraamu was correct and that Robert had to be at the tiki with John. Jeff corrects his statement and declares Maraamu the winning tribe.\nBack at the camps, Maraamu feasts while Rotu declares it didn't really need food and that the Maraamu members would just make themselves sick eating all that food. Paschal is disappointed that Rotu turned on Gabriel, and he and Neleh bond with Gina which concerns Kathy. Rob confronts Zoe about being in an alliance, which she denies.

Each tribe later gets a tree mail message telling them they have five minutes to select one member to hike to a destination unknown. Rob volunteers to go for Rotu, while Kathy is picked to go for Maraamu.\nRob and Kathy eventually cross paths with one another and meet Jeff at a meeting place called a Tohua. Jeff explains to the two of them that by being sent there, they have been chosen as ambassadors who will be responsible for the upcoming tribal merge. Both would spend the night there to discuss tribal situations, decide on the new tribe's name and paint the new tribe's flag. After leading both ambassadors to a picnic table, Jeff surprises them with a feast of pizza and beer. As they eat, Rob shocks Kathy by telling her that her old tribemates from Rotu plan on aligning with him, Sean and Vecepia to target the remaining Maraamu members upon the merge.

Upon arrival at Rotu, Kathy, Neleh, Paschal and Rob receive a big welcome from everyone else. Despite being glad to see everyone, Kathy was hesitant due to what Rob told her the night before. When Rob gathers everyone else around, he passes out the new purple buffs, presents the new tribe's flag revealing the new tribe's name as Soliantu (meaning \"Sacred Allegiance to the Sun\"). Shortly after settling down from all the excitement, things are back to business as usual. Kathy approaches Paschal and explains why she feels vulnerable.

The first player to get their kite 300 feet in the air wins a king-size Snickers candy bar and a scuba diving trip at a coral reef.During the challenge, several players find it difficult to get their kites up, but Kathy's kite rises above all others, clinching her another victory.\nWhile Kathy is out scuba diving, voting strategies are being made as Neleh and Paschal align with John, Robert, Tammy and Zoe planning to vote out Sean at the next tribal council. When Kathy returns, she shares her Snickers bar with her tribemates. Although all are appreciative of Kathy to do so, John is not impressed saying that his share of Kathy's bar is not enough to change his vote. Sensing vulnerability, Sean urges Kathy to vote with him hoping that Neleh and Paschal will follow suit. Kathy agrees with Sean theorizing that John and Tammy are playing in such a way that would make them difficult to vote out. However, Neleh disagrees with Kathy explaining that there will always be alliances and that the more you speak out, the more vulnerable you become.

When a player reaches a station, they must insert their torch in a slot, signifying that the station is occupied and not allowing another player to enter. If a player reaches into the bag below the right answer, they will find a tiki which must be attached to their necklace. Otherwise, they will find a bone which must be taken to a fire wok and dropped in as a sacrifice before continuing on, costing valuable time. The first player to answer five questions correctly and cross the finish line with five tikis wins.At the immunity challenge, it was a frantic race as the five players raced to answer questions about a Marquesan story which Jeff told them. Although she and Neleh each dropped one tiki on their way to the finish line, Kathy found the tiki she dropped and came out on top, winning individual immunity.\nThe next day, Kathy continues to weigh out her voting options before she and the others hike to tribal council where the debate from the previous night continued where they left off and with far more tension. Although he tried to influence Kathy's vote one last time, Sean was voted out over Neleh, making him the fifth member of the jury."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US04","season_name":"Survivor: Marquesas","season":4,"episode_number_overall":56,"episode":14,"episode_title":"The Sole Survivor","episode_label":"Finale","episode_date":"2002-05-19","episode_length":97,"viewers":25870000,"imdb_rating":7.9,"n_ratings":121,"episode_summary":"After returning to camp from a heated tribal council, the final four members of the Soliantu Tribe sit around the fire to discuss the outcome of the vote. Having cast the deciding vote, Kathy dwells on her final decision to vote out Sean not knowing whether or not she did the right thing by doing so. The next day, Paschal struggles with his island routine saying that he is in good mental shape but bad physical shape. After a duet of \"Show Me the Way to Go Home,\" Kathy and Neleh let out a scream hoping to relieve their physical and mental fatigues. Having heard their screams, Vecepia decides that in spite of loving them, she has had enough with her tribemates.\nThat night, the final four players hike to tribal council where their next immunity challenge takes place.\n\nImmunity challenge: At tribal council, the final four players are each given a pad of paper. Jeff asks them a series of questions relating to the twelve players who had been voted out or the events that happened throughout the course of the game. Once a question is asked, the players must write down their answers and reveal them once all four have finished writing. Each player gets one point per correct answer. Whoever scores ten points first wins.The first of several questions that they are asked is a two-parter to which Neleh gets two points on, while everyone else get one point apiece. Although the lead is tied for most of the game, Vecepia is the first to reach ten points, winning her individual immunity. Shortly before the vote, Kathy negotiates with Vecepia by asking her to keep her immunity but not vote against her in order to force a tie. Vecepia accepts Kathy's offer and casts the deciding vote against Neleh. The vote is tied as Kathy and Neleh receive two votes each. Jeff then reveals that in the tie-breaker previous tribal council votes do not count nor do questions and answers as opposed to previous seasons. Instead, the players are given two minutes to discuss who should be next to go  and come to a unanimous decision as to whether Kathy or Neleh will be voted out. Failure to finalize such decision means all but Vecepia picking colored rocks (two yellow, one purple) out of a bag. Picking the purple rock means being the next to go. After the discussion, no decision is made. So Jeff brings the bag around and one at a time, Neleh, Kathy and Paschal reach into the bag and pull out a rock. When Jeff signals the three of them to reveal their rocks, Kathy and Neleh each had a yellow rock, leaving Paschal with the purple rock. Therefore, Paschal, despite never receiving one vote at previous tribal councils, is the next player eliminated and becomes the sixth member of the jury.\nAt 3:00AM the next morning, Jeff comes to Soliantu and wakes up the final three players and lets them know of the day ahead of them. Upon conclusion of the description, Jeff gives the final three players a map to where they will later journey to before leaving them to assemble an outrigger canoe. With their canoe completed, Kathy, Neleh and Vecepia paddle to the other side of the island. Shortly after reaching shore, they find a mat with brushes and black body paint with which they paint symbols and personal images on their bodies similar to the tattoos worn by local Marquesan tribesmen. Once painted, they hike along a high ridge where they encounter the torches of the first thirteen players eliminated from the game and reflect on the time they spent with them. After passing all thirteen torches, the final three players hike to an area of purification where, after saying a prayer, they bathe to cleanse their spirits using a mixture of oils and spices. As their cleansing ritual commences, Kathy reflects on herself and the other two remaining players and finds it amazing that the three of them have made it to Day 38 in spite of their different ways of life. After adorning themselves with flowers, the three remaining players hike the rest of the way and meet Jeff for the final immunity challenge.\n\nImmunity challenge: The final three players stand on two logs and lean forward to have one hand on the immunity idol. If a player lets go of the idol, lifts up one foot or touches the idol or supporting tiki with their free hand, they are out of the game. The last player standing wins.The challenge goes long into sundown. About four and a half hours into the challenge, Neleh suggests that Kathy fixes her top. Doing so with her free hand causes Kathy to lose her balance and fall off her logs, putting her out of the game. After Kathy limps off to the side, Vecepia tries to make a deal with Neleh by asking if she will take her to the final two if she steps off. Neleh agrees and Vecepia steps off her logs, giving Neleh individual immunity.\nWhen the final three players arrive at tribal council, they notice that Paschal is not among the members of the jury. Jeff explains that Paschal collapsed before tribal council was to start and had been evacuated to medical care. Having witnessed the incident and being a registered nurse, John is asked by Jeff to explain what happened. John explains that Paschal fainted on his feet and showed signs of dehydration but was within normal limits, talking, alert and knew where he was. Kathy, Neleh and Vecepia are relieved when John assures them that Paschal will be fine. The three of them move on to discuss what happened at the immunity challenge. Kathy admits her mistake by trying to fix her top and falling from the logs as a result, leading Vecepia to make her deal with Neleh, much to the jury's chagrin when Jeff points it out. Neleh explains that she accepted Vecepia's offer because she was convinced that she would be the next to go if she didn't win. Before long, Jeff sends Neleh to cast the one vote to determine who will be the final player to be eliminated from the game. When Jeff tallies Neleh's vote, it is revealed that Kathy is the final player voted out of the game and the seventh and final member of the jury. Neleh and Vecepia thus became the first final two who originally started on two different tribes.\nUpon returning to camp from tribal council, Neleh and Vecepia tend to their fire where they later sit by and pray for Paschal's health before turning in for the night. Shortly after waking up to their final morning and preparing breakfast, the final two players notice a pig and two chickens near their camp. The two of them later take their last mud bath in the shallow waters near their beach. When they return to shore, they start up a bonfire and ceremoniously burn unwanted clothes left behind by their former tribemates. All the while, the two finalists are curious as to how the jury will interpret their methods of gameplay. Vecepia hopes the jury will define her methods as strategic, decisive and partly deceiving, while Neleh hopes that the jury will know that she has been upfront and honest. Both ladies somberly take one last look at the ocean before hiking to their final tribal council.\nEach jury member has different feelings about the events leading to the final day. Paschal feels that the game was played honestly and does not know what caused Neleh and Vecepia to make it so far other than luck. Kathy cannot process the game and has not focused on whom to vote for. Zoe thinks it is best to have an all-woman's final and that both Neleh and Vecepia are deserving of the million dollars. Despite not feeling so good about Neleh and Vecepia being the final two and that they lasted longer than him, Robert sees his jury vote as a coup for himself. Sean says that the money will not be swayed by his preference for race and thinks the best player should win regardless. Unable to feel the jury's power until joining the jury herself, Tammy does not think that Neleh nor Vecepia deserve to win the money and must decide who played best and deceived her the least. John feels that how the final two will react to his statement will determine who gets his vote.\nWhen Neleh and Vecepia arrive at their final tribal council, they are glad to see Paschal back on his feet and among the rest of the jury. After explaining the procedure, Jeff has both finalists make their opening statements. Neleh states that she has had an incredible time, that everything she did for the other players was out of love, that she gave everything 100% and loves them regardless of their vote. Vecepia states that she wanted to have a strategy, develop relationships, avoid riding other players' coattails and prove herself with her work ethic, spirituality and gumption to be her best.\nThe jury then approaches Neleh and Vecepia with questions and comments. Tammy states that she was going to lie, cheat and do what she could to win but changed her strategy because she felt bad about her gameplay because of Neleh and Vecepia's \"holier-than-Thou\" attitude. Tammy considers the two finalists as hypocrites and possibly the biggest liars due to condemning herself along with John, Robert and Zoe for being manipulative only to be the same way behind their backs through Christianity. Tammy feels that Kathy deserves the million dollars more than Neleh and Vecepia but congratulates them anyway for beating her at her own game. Sean asks the final two if there was a moral message they gained gameplay. Neleh says that at times, she wanted to follow her heart but felt she couldn't due to an alliance she had made and learned to always follow her heart. Vecepia, on the other hand, says that when in a situation, she will think it through before giving her word. Paschal considers both finalists deserving of making it to the end, the epitome of what America has to offer and would have been glad to have had either of them as his daughters. Robert asks the finalists if there was any decision they made or action they took that could be their downfall. Vecepia says that she regrets what she did to Kathy, while Neleh says that she regrets Robert and Zoe leaving when they did. Zoe believes that both Neleh and Vecepia are good-hearted and congratulates them for making it to the end. Kathy asks Neleh which point in the game she did her most dramatic strategic movement, what her decision was and when and the decision she made herself. Neleh explains that she really started playing on Day 24 when she along with Kathy, Paschal, Sean and Vecepia started targeting the Rotu alliance of John, Robert, Tammy and Zoe. Kathy then asked Vecepia how she could go on playing the game by adjusting alliances and not feel part of such cunning manner to which Vecepia explains that her strategy was to wait for people to approach her. After angrily stating how he feels about integrity and stating that both of them lied, John asks why he should vote for either finalist. Neleh states that she was going to join his alliance with Robert, Tammy and Zoe hoping that somehow she would finish further than fifth place but chose not to due to finding out that would not happen. Vecepia states that John knew she came in with a strategy and played the game at her best to get to the end.\nIn conclusion, Vecepia stated that regardless of she and Neleh responded to what the jury had to say, that the jury finds the answers to decide justly. Neleh asked the jury to consider how she treated them, her love and compassion and that luck got her to the end. Shortly afterwards, the jury casts their vote for who they feel deserves the million dollars. Once the votes are cast, Jeff retrieves the voting urn but does not tally the votes right away saying that they will be tallied after they return to the United States. Jeff then leaves the tribal council area, boards an arriving helicopter and flies away."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US04","season_name":"Survivor: Marquesas","season":4,"episode":15,"episode_title":"The Reunion","episode_label":"Reunion","episode_date":"2002-05-19","episode_length":34,"viewers":17890000,"imdb_rating":5.4,"n_ratings":147,"episode_summary":"Months later, Jeff arrives in New York City in the same helicopter he left the tribal council area in with the voting urn in hand, Jeff hails a taxicab which takes him to Central Park where the two finalists and the seven members of the jury await him on a big stage before a live audience of cheering fans.

Neleh receives the votes of Kathy, Paschal, and Zoe, but in the end, Vecepia receives the votes of Sean, Robert, Tammy, and John and is declared the winner of the million dollars and the title of Sole Survivor.

The three castaways each stepped on the scale and discovered how much weight they had lost over 38 days.

Matthew responded by saying that Jenna did not contribute much around camp and that she had the desire to quit. Jenna responded by saying that Matthew hadn't been playing the game, didn't need the money, and that it was \"just another adventure on his list of things to do\". Alex stated to the finalists that the words \"honesty\" and \"integrity\" didn't mean anything to him anymore. He asks them about their biggest regret. Jenna says it was putting trust in untrustworthy people. Matthew says it was his decision to support Ryan at the first vote.\nNext up was Heidi, who asked the finalists whether they felt there was someone else more deserving of being in their position. Both Jenna and Matthew answered Rob. Deena was concerned about Jenna's statement that Matthew didn't need the money, and wonders if they should vote on need and not gameplay. Jenna responded that if she were on the jury, she would vote on need, but understands that others may feel differently. Deena then stated to Matthew that she was offended by the comment \"may the best man win\" he made at an earlier Tribal Council. Matthew apologized to Deena. Next up was Christy, who asked the finalists what their reactions were when they learned she was deaf. Matthew responded by claiming he thought she had a \"funky accent\". Christy demanded an explanation from Jenna about her comment that she, Jenna, was \"handicapped because she was beautiful\". Jenna claimed that she didn't remember making that comment, but says she feels others judged her as not smart or strong because she's a swimsuit model. Last up was Dave, who asked which influential leader a castaway should emulate in the game. Matthew answered Colin Powell, while Jenna chose her mother for \"her fight and strength\".

Host Jeff Probst threw the contestants' sneakers overboard, and they were given a sack of Panamanian currency. The two tribes, Morgan and Drake, were sent to buy surviving essentials at a local village. When they reached the village, Morgan was scrambling to get supplies, while Drake was more successful, as Sandra was able to speak Spanish with the locals.

After they were finished buying goods, the tribes got on their marine vessels and traveled to their respective islands.

At Ulong, Jeff Wilson twisted his ankle when he accidentally stepped into a stray coconut. \n\nImmunity challenge: The tribes would partake in a beach run, clipped to each other by a rope and carrying backpacks with 20 pounds of sandbag weight. The tribes would begin at opposite sides of an oval course. After Jeff Probst's go-signal, the tribes would race to catch up to one another. Any tribe members who fell behind could unclip from the rope and drop out of the race, but they would be forced to pass their sandbag to another player, who must carry the extra weight. The first tribe to catch up to the other tribe and tag them would gain Immunity. A variation on this challenge was used in Survivor: Cook Islands and Survivor: Caramoan.At the immunity challenge, Jeff Wilson's injured ankle was too much to bear as he bailed himself out from the challenge. Koror won Immunity again, and Ulong faced their third successive Tribal Council. Jeff Wilson confessed that his ankle was too much torture for him and asked his team to vote him out, despite Bobby Jon and James' insistence that they oust lazy Kim.

The next day, Katie and Tom ceremoniously burned their shelter and everything that helped them survive the past 39 days. In the Final Tribal Council, Tom was commended for his dominance in challenges and leadership skills; but was berated for being overbearing and a sexist. Katie on the other hand praised for her honesty, but was lambasted for being two-faced, weak in challenges and riding on Ian and Tom's coattails.

Each tribe will perform this Meke in front of Fijian judges who are experts in Fijian dance. They will be judged on three criteria: appearance, authenticity and spirit. Winners will indulge in a Fijian feast of chicken, pork and seafood while enjoying Fijian entertainment.At the Reward Challenge, both Moto and Ravu tied for both appearance and spirit, but Moto beat Ravu in the dance (moves and timing) category. Moto enjoyed a traditional Fijian feast with the natives while Ravu's morale sunk. Lisi struggled at Exile Island during the thunderstorm. She was upset about Ravu continuing to lose challenges and had thoughts on quitting the game.\n\nImmunity Challenge: Using three different weapons, tribes will test their skills. The first round is blowdarts, one shot per tribe member, and whoever gets closest to the bull's eye scores one point for their tribe. The second round is spear throwing; the closest to the bull's eye scores two points for their tribe. For the final round they would shoot a bow and arrow, with the tribe member to hit closest to the bull's eye scoring three points. The tribe with the most points after all three rounds wins Immunity.Moto continued their winning streak by winning all three rounds of the immunity challenge, with Yau-Man showing off some unorthodox but successful techniques in spear throwing and archery. A frustrated Lisi told her tribe that she wanted to be voted out, which made Dreamz happy because he'd never gotten along with her. Lisi then changed her mind and hoped that Alex and Edgardo would vote out Dreamz, but the tribe had enough and decided to vote out Lisi."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US14","season_name":"Survivor: Fiji","season":14,"episode_number_overall":195,"episode":9,"episode_title":"Are We Gonna Live on Exile Island?!","episode_label":"Ep 9","episode_date":"2007-04-12","episode_length":43,"viewers":14250000,"imdb_rating":7.1,"n_ratings":93,"episode_summary":"On day 22, the tribes received tree mail that told them to paddle immediately to Exile Island and to not take any of their rewards with them. When they arrived, they discovered a box in the tower on the island with purple buffs and a note telling them that they were now a merged tribe and they were to return to the Moto camp. When they arrived, everything had been removed and the castaways would have to rebuild from scratch. All the castaways started scrambling for new alliances or tried to bring back together old ones. Michelle chose the name Bula Bula for the merged tribe, meaning \"hello hello.\" At the combined Reward and Immunity Challenge, the castaways were randomly split into two competing teams consisting of a green team (Alex, Dreamz, Michelle, Mookie, and Stacy) and an orange team (Boo, Cassandra, Earl, Edgardo, and Yau-Man). The winning team would be immune and not attend Tribal Council, and the losing team would immediately open a note containing instructions after the challenge.\n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: Shown a large Fijian mask, teams are to memorize the symbols and their arrangement on the mask. Teams will paddle down a river to three stations to retrieve three bundles of puzzle pieces. Once they have retrieved all three bundles, they'll paddle to the finish where two tribe members from each team will then use those pieces to construct six of the symbols from their Fijian mask. The team would then have to place the six symbols on the correct positions on their team mask. The first team to place the symbols in the correct order on their team mask wins immunity and a feast of massive slabs of steak, veggies and seasoning, and a few bottles of wine.Leading from the start, the orange team won the combined Reward and Immunity Challenge, leaving Alex, Dreamz, Michelle, Mookie, and Stacy to go to Tribal Council. The note revealed that they were to go to Tribal Council immediately and were not allowed to discuss anything or strategize.

Each time someone gets an answer correct, they will smash a tower belonging to another tribe member. When all three towers are smashed, that person is out of the challenge. The last person standing wins a huge barbecue and a night aboard a 70-foot luxury yacht.Cassandra won the first individual Reward Challenge, sending Mookie to Exile Island, and bringing along Boo, Dreamz, and Yau-Man on a private yacht trip. During the challenge, which involved each tribe member guessing which competitors were named by the others for numerous questions, Stacy received several negative titles, including \"Who do you NOT want to see after the game is over?\" and \"Who wasted this great opportunity?\". On the yacht, Cassandra and Yau-Man talked Dreamz into their alliance. \n\nImmunity Challenge: The survivors will use their arms to brace themselves between two walls, while their feet are positioned on very narrow footholds. Every 30 minutes Survivors will step down to an even smaller foothold. When they reach the third and final foothold they will stay there as long as they can. If a survivor falls off, they are out of the challenge. The main rule: no hips, no back, and no butts. Arms and feet only.

In the ensuing scramble to decide the vote at Tribal Council, the self-titled \"Four Horsemen\" of Alex, Dreamz, Edgardo, and Mookie figured that Earl must have the other hidden Immunity Idol and planned to vote him off. Both Alex and Yau-Man tried to convince Stacy to join their alliances. In the end, Stacy sided with Yau-Man. Alex, Edgardo, and Mookie told Dreamz that they found the hidden immunity idol at Ravu, which caused Dreamz to waver because they kept it a secret from him.\nDreamz jumped sides and told Cassandra, Earl, and Yau-Man that Mookie had found an Immunity Idol; Cassandra responded, \"Mmmhmm\". Initially, the group of Boo, Cassandra, Dreamz, Earl, Stacy, and Yau-Man decided to target Alex. Feeling threatened, Alex asked Mookie to discreetly give him the hidden Immunity Idol for protection at Tribal Council. Dreamz noticed this exchange and told the Earl's alliance of the swap, and the same group decided to change the target to Mookie. Edgardo later suggested to the Four Horsemen that they vote off Cassandra instead, as she was a strong middle player in the game and if Earl did have the Immunity Idol, their plan may backfire. Seeing that Dreamz may have been playing both sides of the game and hoping to improve her standing with her critical teammates, Stacy suggested to Boo, Cassandra, Earl, and Yau-Man that they vote off Edgardo and not tell Dreamz about this change; regardless of whether Alex and Mookie had the idol (facts unsure by Dreamz's double-sided dealings), Edgardo would be left unprotected and be voted off if the 5-member alliance held. This would also confirm whether Dreamz was trustworthy and cost the Four Horsemen use of the idol. At Tribal Council, Alex played the hidden Immunity Idol, but for naught as he received no votes, and the Earl-led alliance stuck to their plan and voted out Edgardo.

The other teammates will attempt to catch the ball using a basket. Each time someone catches a ball they score a point for their team, regardless of which team's ball they catch.

For the reward, a seaplane will take the winning team to a luxury spa resort where they will have a hot shower, dinner and a night in a bed.Boo struggled in the Reward Challenge when he injured his knee, but he popped it back into place and continued playing. Alex, Dreamz, Earl, and Stacy won the reward and sent Boo to Exile Island. At the spa, Alex scrambled to see if he could get any support from his fellow tribemates, but he could not. Alex and Mookie figured that Yau-Man had the other hidden Immunity Idol from the Moto camp and confirmed this when they searched through his personal belongings. They plotted to confront Yau-Man about the idol at Tribal Council to either get him to lie about having the idol or stir up trouble by casting doubt among his alliance. However, Cassandra and Stacy were nearby, attempting to eavesdrop on the conversation. Although they only heard small parts of the conversation and didn't learn exactly what their adversaries were planning, they were spotted by Mookie and Alex, who then decided to confront Yau-Man immediately. They attempted to blackmail Yau-Man into telling his alliance about the hidden Immunity Idol or they would tell them. Yau-Man decided to tell the members of his alliance, but the strongest reaction was anger that Alex and Mookie went through Yau-Man's personal bag. \n\nImmunity Challenge: Testing their memory, each Survivor will secretly select three squares on a grid, horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The goal is to knock out their opposing teammate by guessing squares and bombing them one by one. When all three squares belonging to a Survivor are knocked out, they'll be out of the challenge. The last person with squares still left on the board wins individual Immunity.At the Immunity Challenge, Stacy won immunity by taking out Yau-Man and Alex. Boo convinced his alliance that it would be better to split the votes between Alex and Mookie, just in case either of them had found the remaining idol, even though neither of them had any clues about the rehidden idol. At Tribal Council, it was admitted openly that Yau-Man had the hidden Immunity Idol and that Alex and Mookie were on the outside. The six-person alliance held to their plan of splitting their vote between Mookie and Alex, but Alex voted against Mookie to successfully avoid a tie.

The first two people to find their climbing steps and cross the finish line will move on to the final stage. There they will use those climbing steps to ascend to the top of a 12-foot pole and retrieve their flag.

However, the energy expended by Alex and Dreamz was too much for them to overcome and Boo won individual immunity for the first time.

Calling on her professional wrestling skills, Ashley attempted to grapple with the heavier Jean-Robert. Jean-Robert dragged Ashley along behind him and took out Frosti, leaving James free and clear to score the winning point for Fei Long. The twist was that Fei Long was to kidnap a member of Zhan Hu who would stay with them until the next immunity challenge. Fei Long opted to kidnap Jaime as she was seen as a \"spot of sunshine\" and thought her being gone from Zhan Hu would be demoralizing. Probst gave Jaime a sealed bamboo tube with instructions to be opened in private once at the Fei Long camp. Jaime opened the sealed bamboo tube to reveal a second, smaller bamboo tube containing a clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol which must be given to a member of Fei Long without opening it before rejoining her tribe at the next immunity challenge. Jaime gave the sealed clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol at Fei Long to Leslie, seeing her as the weakest member of Fei Long.

Along with their new tribe members, each tribe received a basket of fruits, nuts, and wine. The tribal switch caused a lot of plotting of potential future moves by the castaways: Jean-Robert trying to regain the trust of his tribe; Frosti looking for new alliances, and Peih-Gee and Jaime contemplating throwing the next two Immunity Challenges in order to eliminate Aaron and James thus potentially balancing the number of original tribe members should a merge happen with ten players remaining.\n\nImmunity Challenge: Two members of each tribe must dive down from a floating platform to remove sticks that are trapping twelve buoyant puzzle disks, representing the twelve animals in the Chinese Zodiac. Once the members have collected all twelve, they must place the disks in their tribe boat and row the boat to shore to deliver the pieces to three other members of their tribe, who must then place them to match notches on a puzzle board. The first tribe to complete the puzzle wins Immunity.At the Immunity Challenge, Aaron and Erik gave Zhan Hu the lead by arriving on shore with the puzzle pieces first, but Jaime and Peih-Gee sabotaged their tribe's chances by tossing a puzzle piece behind the puzzle board and making minimal effort to solve the puzzle, allowing Fei Long to catch up and win immunity for a fourth time. Aaron and James were upset at Jaime and Peih-Gee's poor performance and seeming lack of concern during the challenge. Back at camp, Erik was surprised to learn that the girls purposely threw the challenge and felt compelled to go along with their plan to stay in the game. At Tribal Council, Jaime admitted to throwing the challenge, prompting disgust from both Aaron and James. James was very vocal in condemning the strategy, even asking to be sent home. The remaining Zhan Hu members felt that Aaron would be a bigger threat because of this later on and voted him out."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US15","season_name":"Survivor: China","season":15,"episode_number_overall":206,"episode":6,"episode_title":"That's Love, Baby!

After introducing themselves, the tribes were divided by schoolyard pick. As traditional in Gabon, Jeff announced that the oldest people usually make the decisions in the tribe and therefore the oldest castaways, Bob and Gillian, started the pick. After the tribes were picked, tribe names Fang and Kota were announced, and buffs passed out, Jeff announced the first challenge for individual Immunity Idols and extra food. \n\nTribal Reward/Individual Immunity Challenge: The tribes would have to race across the plain and up a hill. The first castaway from each tribe to the top of the hill would win an Individual Immunity Idol that would only be good at their tribe's first Tribal Council. The first entire tribe to the top of the hill would win an extra bag of corn and beans.Marcus and GC won individual Immunity Idols and Kota won the extra bag of food. At the Kota tribe, Bob and Ace took charge and organized the campsite. At the Fang tribe, a nighttime visit by an elephant spooked the tribe. Randy hit his head on the tribe's hut, requiring a visit by the Survivor medical team to put in several stitches. \n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: Six tribe members would be belted together and have to race through a swamp, over a net wall, and under and over a series of hitching posts. The six would then have to dig up three bags of puzzle pieces and deliver them to the three remaining tribe members. These three would then assemble the puzzle pieces to win flint and immunity.At a combined Reward/Immunity Challenge, Kota pulled far ahead while digging up the puzzle bags and won by a blowout. Before Tribal Council, Michelle and Gillian were targets for votes due to their negativity and age, respectively. Michelle's negativity outweighed concerns over age and she was voted out. After the vote, Jeff announced that Fang would be taking their torches back to camp and gave them a flint.\nPicked as the leader of Fang at Tribal Council, GC started the tribe's first fire and organized jobs to fix up the campsite. At Kota, Charlie and Marcus formed an alliance; the two expanded their alliance to include Jacquie and Corinne. The four discussed bringing in Bob to have a majority, though Bob would be kept out of the core alliance of four. In the early morning of day 5, GC resigned his leadership of the tribe after arguing with Gillian over waking up early and making too much noise. After receiving tree mail announcing the next challenge, Dan tried to unify Fang by painting everybody with charcoal face paint.\n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: The tribes have to roll a large ball through a series of gates. At two points along the course, a tribe member would have to climb atop the ball to retrieve of set of keys. At the final gate, the keys would unlock three chains that blocked the gate. The first tribe to go through all the gates and roll their boulder atop a short pedestal wins fishing gear and immunity.Despite Fang's attempts to boost morale, Kota won their third challenge in a row. Kota selected Dan to go to Exile Island, where he chose to get a clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol, but he was not able to decode the clue to find it. At Fang, Randy fashioned a fishing hook out of parts from his glasses and the tribe was finally able to get some meat. Gillian suggested to Susie that the two of them form an alliance, fearing they might have been next in line to be voted out since they were the oldest women in the game; she suggested the two vote off Ken because Gillian thought he was useless. Dan's behavior after he returned from Exile Island made the others suspicious that he had found the Hidden Immunity Idol. This caused some of the Fang tribe to reconsider voting out Gillian, and instead vote for Dan. At Tribal Council, Gillian's weakness at physical challenges was seen as a greater concern than Dan's potential of having the Hidden Immunity Idol and she was voted out."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US17","season_name":"Survivor: Gabon","season":17,"episode_number_overall":230,"episode":2,"episode_title":"She Obviously is Post-Op!","episode_label":"Ep 2","episode_date":"2008-10-02","episode_length":44,"viewers":13080000,"imdb_rating":7.2,"n_ratings":215,"episode_summary":"At Fang, the argument over who was or was not the tribe leader continued.

Two members of the opposing tribe would attempt to remove the tribe member from the post and drag them across the sand to the finish line. The first tribe to get the member of the other tribe across the finish line would receive one point. The first tribe to score two points wins blankets, a hammock, pillows, and a mat.At the Reward Challenge, Ace chose Paloma to hang onto the post.  However, the Fang members easily overpowered her, leading to their first victory.  They also elected to send Sugar to Exile Island.  The win re-energized the Fang tribe and they finally felt like a team.  Meanwhile, at Kota, Paloma's poor effort at the challenge caused her to be seen as the weakest link in the tribe.  Corinne talked to Bob about joining her alliance of four, though she kept him in the dark about his status in the endgame. On Exile Island, Sugar elected to receive a clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol over comfort and followed the clues to find the Hidden Immunity Idol. Sugar then revealed that her father's recent death was the motivation for her playing the game. \n\nImmunity Challenge: One at a time, six tribe members would slide down a water slide. They would then swim out to retrieve a numbered tile, then run up the hill they slid down to drop their number off. Once all six tiles were retrieved, the remaining castaway would use the tiles to solve a numeric puzzle. The answer to the puzzle is a combination to open a locked chest which holds an ax. The first tribe to open their chest and use the ax to cut a rope that would raise their tribe's flag would win.During the Immunity Challenge, Ken secured Fang's victory by overcoming Kota's lead at the tile retrieval stage and solving the numeric puzzle before Bob.  After the Immunity Challenge and back at their camp, Sugar told Ace that she found the Hidden Immunity Idol while leading the others to believe she didn't have it.  Paloma approached Corinne about forming an alliance and targeting Ace for elimination, due to Ace being manipulative and trying to set her up for failure at the Reward Challenge.

When the tribes next gathered, Jeff announced that the castaways would rank their tribemates by secret survey according to their importance within the tribe. Kota ranked Marcus as most important in their tribe followed by Ace, Bob, Charlie, Jacquie, Corinne, Sugar, and Kelly. Fang ranked Matty as most important in their tribe followed by Dan, Randy, Crystal, Ken, GC, and Susie. After announcing the rankings, Jeff told the castaways to drop their buffs as they would be picking new tribes by schoolyard pick once again. Voted as most important within their tribes, Marcus and Matty stayed with their original tribes and started the draft. The new Kota was Marcus, Dan, Charlie, Randy, Corinne, Susie, and Bob, while the new Fang tribe consisted of Matty, Ace, Crystal, Jacquie, Ken, Kelly, and GC. As Sugar was not selected during the process, she was sent to Exile Island. She would stay there until after the next Tribal Council and then join the tribe that lost the next Immunity Challenge.

The first tribe to throw the ball three times into their opponents goal would win.At the Immunity Challenge, Randy scored all three goals for Kota in their shutout victory over Fang. Kelly's poor performance at the challenge made Crystal, GC, and Ken reconsider their alliance with her, as they now perceived her as the weakest member of the tribe. However, they decided to target Jacquie instead, realizing that Sugar might have the Hidden Immunity Idol and with it, the trio of Ace, Sugar, and Jacquie would hold power within the tribe. They wanted to ensure that Ace in particular had as little power as possible, as he was also a physical threat. The three shared their plan with Matty to persuade him to vote their way, but he immediately informed Jacquie of the development. Jacquie tried to plead her case to Ken and Crystal, casting herself as an outsider who was not allied with Ace and really wanted to remain in the game.

An opposing tribe member would stand in front of the wall and use a club to try to knock away the fruit as it was thrown through the air. Once a piece of fruit is caught by a tribe member, it would have to be thrown through a hole in a second wall defended by a second opposing tribe member. The tribe that catches the most fruit by weight after five minutes would win an herb garden, salt, oil, chili sauce, and all fruit collected from the challenge.At the Reward Challenge, a strategy change of tossing two fruit at a time over Ace defending the second wall helped Kota win the challenge by 2 pounds (0.91 kg). Kota chose to send Sugar to Exile Island for the third time in a row, with Dan stating that it was a strategy move to force her to play the Hidden Immunity Idol before the tribal merge as they wanted it back into circulation. At Exile Island, Sugar once again opted for the comfort. At the Fang camp, the pressure of the game started to get to GC and he argued with Crystal. Immediately before they were to leave for the Immunity Challenge, he went off alone in the tribe's kayak, causing his tribemates to call out for him. He returned just before they left for the challenge. \n\nImmunity Challenge: One member from each tribe would roll a large ball made of interwoven sticks down a hill. A blindfolded tribe member at the bottom of the hill would attempt to block the opposing tribe's ball with a shield and the aid of a caller.

Randy's taunting of an emotional Crystal did not sit well with her and she predicted that the old Fang and new Fang members would not get along. Kota chose to send Sugar back to Exile Island for the fourth time. Unlike her last visit where she enjoyed the food with the comfort, Sugar felt guilty about eating while her fellow tribe members subsisted on three scoops of rice. Kelly thought that Crystal crying after the Reward Challenge was a sign of weakness, but Crystal said that it was not. \n\nImmunity Challenge: The tribes would divide into three pairs. Each pair would be tethered together by a rope.

Crystal also wanted to blindside Sugar or vote out Ace, but Matty told her of Ace's plans. Ken talked to Matty about blindsiding Ace, but Matty told Ken that he made a promise that he could not break. Lastly, Ken talked to Sugar about Ace and she told Ken that she had given the idol to Ace.

Over at Fang's camp site, the tribe tried to start over and looked ahead to an expected tribal merger. After tree mail hinted at a tribal merge, the castaways packed up their personal items and went to a beach for a feast. At the feast, a clue for a second Hidden Immunity Idol was tucked under a locked box that the castaways would open after the feast was over. Ken noticed the note first, but when he tried to get the note for himself, Charlie saw the note and forced Ken to share the note with everybody. When nobody showed much interest in going to find the idol for fear of looking greedy, Marcus proposed to dig up the Hidden Immunity Idol, but to throw it in the ocean so that nobody could use it. Although many were tempted to take the Idol, the castaways finally agreed to throw it into the ocean. When the castaways opened the locked box, they were instructed to each draw a numbered stone from a bag. A second note was then read, stating that they had just selected new tribes. Castaways with odd numbers would be the new Fang and the even numbers the new Kota. At the new Kota, Marcus identified Crystal as the cousin of one of his friends, forming a connection with her. The two agreed not to write each other's names down at Tribal Council, but Crystal later stated in a confessional she had no intention to be loyal to him. Marcus tried to convince Susie to join his alliance with himself and Bob. At the new Fang, Corinne felt that the greatest threat to her alliance with Marcus was Matty and she wanted to vote him out next. Matty told Sugar that Ace never targeted her contrary to what Ken told her and she felt bad about blindsiding Ace at the last Tribal Council. The two formed a new alliance. Concerned over how Susie would vote at a Kota Tribal Council, Randy talked to Charlie and Corinne about throwing the next Immunity Challenge to force Fang to go to Tribal Council where the three would vote out Matty. \n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would hold two poles on the tops of their hands up against a board over their heads. Any movement in their hands would cause the poles to drop to the ground. If the castaway dropped his or her poles, he would be eliminated from the challenge. The last person who does not drop their poles would win immunity for their tribe and keep all of its members safe. In other words, the first tribe to have all its members drop their poles would lose immunity.At the Immunity Challenge, Matty outlasted Bob and he won the challenge for Fang, spoiling Charlie, Corinne, and Randy's plans. Marcus tried to keep the Kota six alliance going by approaching Crystal about replacing Susie in the Kota six and voting out Ken followed by Susie, but she did not want to vote out her ally, Ken. Marcus told a different story to Susie, telling her the plan would be to vote out Ken followed by Crystal. He also promised to take Susie to the final three. Not wanting to betray her long term alliance with Ken, Crystal told Ken what Marcus told her. Crystal tried to convince Susie that Marcus's promise of a final three was not possible because Corinne and Randy disliked Susie too much to allow that to happen. At Tribal Council, Susie decided to join Crystal and Ken, and they made Marcus the first member of the jury."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US17","season_name":"Survivor: Gabon","season":17,"episode_number_overall":236,"episode":8,"episode_title":"The Brains Behind Everything","episode_label":"Ep 8","episode_date":"2008-11-13","episode_length":44,"viewers":12890000,"imdb_rating":7.5,"n_ratings":212,"episode_summary":"Several castaways expected a merge notice via tree mail, but instead the tribes received a Reward Challenge note.

The tribe that put their ball in the hole using fewer shots would receive one point. The first tribe to score two points would win an overnight trip to a Gabonese village.Fang came from behind to win the Reward Challenge. Corinne announced that Fang was going to send Bob to Exile Island, hoping that he would find the Hidden Immunity Idol, but not knowing that Sugar had already found it. At Exile Island, Bob followed the clues to the Hidden Immunity Idol and found the location where the idol would have been. Unable to find the idol and thinking that Sugar may have found it, Bob fabricated a fake Hidden Immunity Idol that he hoped to use as a bluff. On day 27, before the start of the Immunity Challenge, Jeff announced that the tribes had merged. \n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would make a fire large enough to burn through a rope using flint, steel, and a box of fire making supplies. The first castaway to completely burn through their rope would win immunity.Susie and Sugar were the only two castaways to get a fire started during the Immunity Challenge, with Susie being the first to burn through her rope to win individual immunity. The castaways returned to the old Fang campsite, found that they had received new food supplies, and named themselves Nobag (\"Gabon\" backwards). The alliance of Charlie, Corinne, and Randy saw Sugar as a swing vote at Tribal Council to vote for Crystal, whom Randy wanted voted out. Sugar told Charlie and Corinne that she could not live with Randy any more and Corinne tried to convince Sugar that if she voted with their alliance that they would vote Randy out next. To get revenge for forcing him to share the note about the second Hidden Immunity Idol at the feast, Ken decided to blindside Charlie by fabricating a story that Charlie was the brains behind the Kota alliance. Ken told the story to his alliance of Crystal, Matty, and Susie who believed his story and agreed to vote for Charlie. Ken told the same story to Sugar in an effort to get her vote for Charlie. At Tribal Council, Crystal confronted Randy over why he disliked her so much. Sugar joined the alliance of Crystal, Ken, Matty, and Susie, because she did not want to align with Randy and Corinne, and Charlie was sent to the jury."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US17","season_name":"Survivor: Gabon","season":17,"episode_number_overall":237,"episode":9,"episode_title":"Nothing Tastes Better Than Five Hundred Dollars","episode_label":"Ep 9","episode_date":"2008-11-20","episode_length":44,"viewers":12500000,"imdb_rating":8.4,"n_ratings":231,"episode_summary":"Not knowing that Sugar had the Hidden Immunity Idol, Bob told her that he did not have it and showed her the fake idol that he made. \n\nSurvivor Auction: Instead of a Reward Challenge, a Survivor Auction was held. Each castaway was given $500. Items won included food and drinks, a secret item for the next Immunity Challenge, the power to send someone to Exile Island and take their remaining money, and a hot bath with fresh clothes.The second item up for bid was unknown as it was covered. After making the winning bid, Ken discovered he had won the right to send somebody to Exile Island and take their money. He chose Bob who immediately departed for Exile Island. For the second to last item at the auction, Corinne won a sealed bottle with a note that would give her an advantage at the next Immunity Challenge. Randy won the last item of the auction, chocolate chip cookies to share with the tribe. Sugar declined the first cookie offered to her which Randy then split between Matty and Corinne. Without taking one for himself, Randy offered Sugar the last cookie. She took it and gave it to Matty which upset Randy. At Exile Island, after getting no additional help from the Hidden Immunity Idol clue, Bob decided to go on a personal safari instead of looking for the idol. After the auction, Corinne and Randy talked to Matty about joining their alliance with Bob. Instead of joining with Corinne and Randy, Matty lobbied his alliance to vote out Bob next instead of Randy. Randy decided that the only option available to his alliance was to annoy the Fang alliance, get them to all vote for him, pull out the Hidden Immunity Idol that he assumed Bob had found, and blindside Susie at Tribal Council in revenge for her flipping to the Fang alliance. Randy told Matty that Matty had \"whored [himself] out\" to the original Kota alliance, at which point Matty rescinded his voting off order and gave into his alliance's want of voting Randy off. \n\nImmunity Challenge: In the first round, the castaways would race across a series of balance beams carrying a bag of puzzle blocks. The first two castaways to bring all three of their bags would go to the final round in which each player must stack all of their pieces like a line of domino tiles while avoiding ropes that would topple the tiles that were already stacked. Once all of the blocks were properly stacked, the castaway would start a chain reaction which would release a flag. The first castaway to raise their flag would win.At the Immunity Challenge, Corinne's sealed note that she bought at the Survivor Auction stated that she would skip the first round and go directly to the final round. Despite her advantage, Ken defeated her and Matty in the final round. After the Immunity Challenge, Bob told Sugar that he still did not have the Hidden Immunity Idol and she told him that he should give his fake idol to Randy. Figuring that he had nothing to lose and it would keep him in the game, Bob agreed to Sugar’s plan and gave Randy the fake idol. At Tribal Council, Randy pulled out the idol before the votes were read. Jeff announced that it was not a hidden immunity idol and tossed the idol into the fire pit.

Corinne and Sugar argued over how to play the game. At the Reward Challenge, the castaways got to view a short video clip from their loved ones before the schoolyard pick. Jeff said that the castaways' loved ones were not around the corner and he only had the videos of them. Because \"today is all about love\" according to Jeff, nobody was sent to Exile Island. \n\nReward Challenge: The castaways would be split into two teams of three by schoolyard pick. The unpicked castaway would be ineligible to win the reward. The teams would be roped together and have to race through a swamp to collect seven sprocket pieces at two different stations. After collecting all the sprockets, the team would have to assemble them on a board in order to turn another sprocket which in turn would raise a flag. The members of the winning team would move on to the final round to individually solve a sliding puzzle. The first castaway to solve the puzzle would win a video from their loved one, pizza, beer, and brownies. Not announced at the challenge was an in-person visit from their loved one.The schoolyard pick resulted in one team of Susie, Matty, and Ken and another team of Crystal, Sugar, and Bob; Corinne was not picked, so she could not win. The team of Bob, Crystal, and Sugar came from behind to win the first round of the challenge and moved on to the final round. Bob won the Reward Challenge by quickly solving his sliding puzzle first. Jeff then told the rest of the tribe that he had nothing for them and told them to head back to camp. While Bob was watching the video clip from his wife, she paused and said that there was \"something I wanted to show you\" and moved off-camera. Contrary to what Jeff said at the start of the Reward Challenge, Peggy, Bob's wife, was in Gabon and she stepped around the corner to surprise Bob. Bob and Peggy then walked hand in hand to the Nobag campsite to meet the rest of the castaways. After introducing his wife to the tribe, Bob turned and whistled to signal the other castaways' loved ones to make an appearance. Matty proposed to his girlfriend, Jamie. The loved ones departed camp before sundown. Bob shared with Corinne a plan to blindside Matty where Bob would make up a second fake Immunity Idol and tell the Fang alliance that it was the idol that Marcus threw into the ocean. Bob's story was that Marcus only threw the bottle into the ocean, had hidden the idol around the camp, and told Bob where it was. \n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would be asked trivia questions about Gabon. For each question answered correctly, the castaway would earn one ball. After four questions are asked, the castaways would throw the balls that they won down a hill at a target divided into zones. The castaway who throws their ball into the zone closest to the center of the target would win.At the Immunity Challenge, Bob won by throwing his second ball one zone from the center. With Bob's win, Corinne expanded upon her blindsiding plan with Bob by concocting the story that Bob would have played the idol tossed into the ocean at the next Tribal Council, but since he won Individual Immunity, he would give Corinne the lost idol. Bob and Corinne hoped that the threat of Corinne having an idol would deter the Fang alliance from voting for her and would instead vote for Matty. Corinne told the story to Ken, which he believed and he suggested that Bob and Corinne approach Crystal with their plan. Bob told the story to Crystal and showed her the second fake idol. Crystal and Ken talked about their voting strategy under this plan where Ken would vote for Matty, Crystal would vote for Corinne, resulting in a 4-3 vote split between Corinne and Matty, respectively, Corinne would play the lost idol negating votes against her, the lost idol would be flushed, and Matty would be going home.

They would then return to the start and toss the ball into a net. The first castaway to retrieve all three balls and get them into the net would win an overnight helicopter trip to a gorilla sanctuary in Loango National Park, a meal, a shower, and a bed to sleep in.Bob won the Reward Challenge and chose to take Crystal and Ken along on the trip and to send Susie to Exile Island. While on the trip, Bob reiterated his promise to give the immunity necklace to Ken. Ken decided that he would only take it if he felt he was in danger of being voted out. On Exile Island, Susie selected the comfort choice because she knew that Sugar already had the Hidden Immunity Idol. Back at camp, Matty tried to get Sugar to give him the Hidden Immunity Idol. After returning from the reward trip, Crystal yelled at Matty for him questioning Crystal and Ken's loyalty to him. The yelling made Sugar change her opinion about Crystal and Ken. She told Matty that he would not be going home after the next Tribal Council and hatched a plan to take out Crystal and Ken. \n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would be blindfolded during the challenge. At the starting line would be a Gabonese mask. At the other end of a net obstacle would be a duplicate mask with some pieces removed. Three bags of puzzle pieces would need to be carried across the net obstacle one at a time. The puzzle pieces would then need to be assembled to replicate the mask at the start line.

At Tribal Council, Ken felt confident going into Tribal Council that he would not be voted out, but that confidence was misplaced as he was unanimously sent to the jury.\nBefore the start of the final Immunity Challenge, the Final Four took the traditional journey honoring the castaways voted out before them.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would be given 200 wooden tiles. The first castaway to use the tiles to build a house of cards 10 feet (3.0 m) tall would win. There is a time limit of 30 minutes for the challenge. If after 30 minutes, no castaway has built the house of cards to over 10 feet (3.0 m) tall, the castaway who builds the tallest house of cards at the end of the time limit would win.Susie broke Bob's challenge winning streak by having built the tallest house of cards after 30 minutes. Sugar thought about forcing a tie at the next Tribal Council due to her loyalty towards Bob for being a father figure. Bob went off into the trees to practice starting a fire, anticipating a fire making tiebreaker challenge. At Tribal Council, Sugar did force a 2–2 tie between Bob and Matty. The tiebreaker challenge was to create a fire large enough to burn through a rope, which Bob won after resuscitating his initial fire to burn through his rope before Matty managed to even get one started. As a result, Matty became the final member of the jury.\nThe final three spent their last day at camp eating the traditional feast and burning down one of the huts at the campsite. At the final Tribal Council, Charlie asked Sugar and Susie why they felt they should be voted at the \"top of the totem pole\" even though they were ranked the second lowest and lowest, respectively, among their tribes before the first tribal switch. He asked Bob if the \"intimate cuddling and spooning all night long\" was more enjoyable than he would liked to admit. Crystal asked no question of Susie, asked Bob to tell her something that Sugar didn't tell him to do, and asked Sugar why she voted her out. Ken asked Susie why she thought she deserved the million dollars and his vote, asked Sugar why she back stabbed him, and Bob about their deal over the immunity necklace. Corinne asked Susie if she would be willing to have her vocal cords removed if she were to win the million dollars. She asked Bob to show the nasty side of Bob and make her believe that he did not like Sugar. She took the opportunity to make a callous comment about Sugar’s deceased father, to which Sugar gave an obscene gesture. Marcus asked no questions of Susie, what Sugar would do to honor her deceased father if she were to win, and for Bob to give one example of a situation in which he was responsible for his decisions. Randy asked Susie to elaborate on the time that Susie said she felt sorry for him and Sugar and Bob if they considered the consequences of putting him on the jury when they gave him the fake Hidden Immunity Idol.

Jeff then announced that the tribe's campsites were about a 4-hour trek by foot away, that one person from each tribe \"would not be making the journey\" and a vote would take place immediately. Jalapao voted for Sandy and Timbira voted for Sierra. Sandy and Sierra thought they were being voted out the game, but Jeff announced that they would only not be making the trek to camp and instead would be flown to their campsites by helicopter. When Sandy and Sierra arrived at their respective campsites, they were given the option to start setting up camp or follow clues to a disposable Hidden Immunity Idol that can only be used during their tribe's first Tribal Council. Sandy opted to follow the clues but did not find the idol before her tribe arrived. Sierra opted to start setting up the camp in order to improve her impression with her tribe. Carolina was annoyed that Sandy didn't work on the campsite. Timbira's trek did not end until dark, by which time Sierra had built a shelter big enough to house the entire tribe. Despite her hard work, Coach’s view on Sierra did not change and he still wanted to vote her out first.

The winning tribe would send two castaways to the losing tribe's camp where they would be allowed to steal two items.At the Reward Challenge, Brendan, Tyson, and Debbie shouldered the weight for Timbira, and J.T., Joe, and Taj for Jalapao. Brendan dropped out first when he was about to carry 220 pounds (100 kg). Tyson dropped out next at 140 pounds (64 kg), leaving just Debbie for Timbira. J.T. carried 220 pounds (100 kg) before dropping out next, tying the weight carried by Rupert Boneham in Survivor: Pearl Islands. Moments later, Joe dropped out at 140 pounds (64 kg), leaving the two women to continue the challenge. Just as both women were to move to carrying 120 pounds (54 kg), Debbie dropped her pole, giving Jalapao their fourth straight challenge victory. In a rare show of sportsmanship for Survivor, Taj congratulated Debbie for a \"hell of a job\". Jalapao selected Sierra to go to Exile Island, but since Brendan did not tell Sierra of his alliance's plan, she immediately picked Taj to join her. Joe and J.T. arrived to raid the Timbira camp and they chose to take Timbira's larger sack of beans and a canister for water. Sandy derided the decision, stating that they should have taken both sacks of Timbira's beans. On Exile Island, Taj got the clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol, which told her it was hidden around the tree mail area. Taj told Sierra about her secret four-way alliance and Sierra readily agreed to join the alliance.\n\nImmunity Challenge: One tribe member at a time would race along a winding path to retrieve a puzzle piece. Each puzzle piece is a large wooden triangular prism with letters written on each of the three faces. Once all eight puzzle pieces are retrieved, they would need to be placed in their correct spot in a frame. The pieces would then need to be rotated to display a scrambled phrase. The first tribe to solve their puzzle would win.At the Immunity Challenge, Timbira broke Jalapao's winning streak. Before Tribal Council, Jalapao was undecided whether to vote out Sandy or Sydney. Ultimately, Taj, J.T., and Stephen did not want to risk Joe and Spencer feeling betrayed by voting Sydney off, so the vote went against Sandy and she was voted out."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US18","season_name":"Survivor: Tocantins","season":18,"episode_number_overall":246,"episode":5,"episode_title":"You're Going to Want that Tooth","episode_label":"Ep 5","episode_date":"2009-03-12","episode_length":44,"viewers":12820000,"imdb_rating":7.9,"n_ratings":115,"episode_summary":"The day after Tribal Council at Jalapao, Taj and Stephen found the Hidden Immunity Idol in the statue next to tree mail. Taj gave the idol to Stephen as he had shorts with pockets and was able to conceal the idol. While the rest of Timbira was off fetching water from the river, Sierra told Brendan that she decided to join the Exile Island alliance. \n\nReward Challenge: A tribe member would sit on a spinning platform at one end of the playing field. Another tribe member would start at the other end and race across to the platform, grab a rope and pull it back to the starting line. The rope would be wound around the base of the platform, causing the platform to spin as the rope is unwound. When the \"puller\" returned to the finish line, the sitting tribe member, now dizzy, would have to race across a balance beam to the finish line. The tribes would race against each other in rounds with the first dizzy tribe member across the finish line scoring one point for their tribe. The first tribe to score three points would win a trip to a cafe with coffee, fresh water, pastries, cookies, muffins, and a toilet with toilet paper.Jalapao won the Reward Challenge by a score of 3–1 and chose Brendan to go to Exile Island; Brendan chose Stephen to join him. Midway through enjoying their reward, J.T. found envelopes with letters from home. Back at Timbira, Tyson told Coach and Debbie that he was suspicious that Brendan was building relationships with members of Jalapao and that they should vote out Brendan at the next Tribal Council. On Exile Island, Brendan talked to Stephen about cementing the secret four-way Exile Island alliance, but Stephen was privately unsure about tying his fate in the game to the alliance. Spencer decided to keep his homosexuality a secret from his tribe, thinking that there was nothing to gain by coming out and also that it might conflict with J.T.'s Southern values. \n\nImmunity Challenge: Two tribemates from each tribe would alternate launching balls from a slingshot while the remaining four tribemates have to catch the balls with handheld nets. Catching a ball would score one point for their tribe. The first tribe to reach five points would win.Despite J.T. losing half of a tooth and almost single-handedly winning the Immunity Challenge for his tribe by catching four balls, Tyson and Brendan helped score a victory for Timbira. Tempers flared at Jalapao over their performance at the Immunity Challenge, with J.T. upset at Spencer's poor defense and Taj venting at Joe.

Joe tried to assure her that she would make it to the merge as she was trustworthy and the men would vote off Taj first. Taj and Stephen discussed telling J.T. about the Hidden Immunity Idol, but not the secret four-way Exile Island alliance in order to secure his vote at the next Tribal Council. Over at Timbira, Coach clashed with his tribe over him burning a pot of beans. \n\nReward Challenge: The tribes would have five minutes to build a barricade of poles tied together with ropes inside two frames of the opposing tribe. The tribes would then have to toss small ceramic pigs from tribemate to tribemate through the two frames, avoiding breaking them against the barricade or dropping them. The tribe which tosses the most intact pigs through the frames after ten minutes would win a trip to a waterfall and a barbecue with hamburgers.The Reward Challenge was closely fought with Timbira winning with a score of 14–13. Timbira decided to send Joe to Exile Island and he chose Erinn to join him, thinking that she would be a good candidate to flip her tribal loyalties once the merge occurred. On Exile Island, Erinn selected the urn with the clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol and shared the clue with Joe. Joe and Erinn thought that if they could find the two Hidden Immunity Idols, they could have a strong alliance together. To counter Joe figuring out Jalapao's Hidden Immunity Idol had already been found, Taj and Stephen crafted a fake idol and placed it in the statue at tree mail. After using the real idol as a model for the fake one she made, Taj tried to hide it her bag, but J.T. stumbled upon the idol after she walked off. Stephen tried to cover for Taj by telling J.T. that Taj had just discovered the idol moments earlier and had shown it to him. A bit later, Taj showed the idol to J.T. and told him that he could have it anytime he needed it. J.T. believed Taj and Stephen to be honest in their story and that he now had a strong alliance with them.\n\nImmunity Challenge: Each tribe would use a slingshot to shoot a tile out in three towers full of sand. After a tile is broken, the sand would be released from the tower which would cause a bag of puzzle pieces to be released and a tile at the next tower would be uncovered. The same tribe member could do all of the shooting with the slingshot or different shooters may be substituted. Once all three bags of puzzle pieces were collected, two tribe members would have to assemble the puzzle. The first tribe to assemble the puzzle correctly wins immunity.At the Immunity Challenge, Tyson gave his tribe a large lead by winning the slingshot shoot out over J.T. Brendan and Erinn finished off the puzzle to give Timbira their third Immunity Challenge win in a row. After the challenge, Joe told his tribemates that Erinn kept the clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol to herself. Using an excuse that he wanted some water, he went to find the idol, not knowing that what he found was a fake. Joe told the tribe to vote out Taj. Stephen and J.T. tried to convince Joe to vote out Sydney but were unable to convince him to change his vote. Stephen and J.T. thought about the possibility of blindsiding Taj at Tribal Council since Stephen had the Hidden Immunity Idol.

Over at Jalapao, an infection on Joe's left leg appeared to have gotten worse. The tree mail on day 19 hinted at a Reward Challenge with a feast for the winner, but the tribes instead arrived at the challenge site to see a hut with a feast and note saying that they had merged. The castaways named their new tribe Forza, a transliteration of força (Portuguese: \"strength\"), and moved to the old Timbira campsite. Coach approached J.T. about forming an alliance, which suited J.T. as he was concerned about Jalapao going into the merge down 4 to 6. After cementing the alliance with J.T., Coach approached Tyson about forming a four-way alliance with J.T. and Stephen, targeting Brendan as the next to be voted out because Coach and Tyson did not trust him. Tyson talked to Stephen and Debbie about the potential alliance. Taj was concerned that Brendan wasn't holding up to his end of the secret Exile Island alliance, but Brendan wanted to keep it a secret and lie low until there were only seven or eight castaways left. Joe and Erinn went to get the Timbira Hidden Immunity Idol, but found nothing and figured out that either Brendan or Sierra had it. \n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would hang onto the top of a pole as long as they can. The last person left hanging without touching the ground would win. This was a rendition of a challenge used in Survivor: Vanuatu and Survivor: Cook Islands and was later used in Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains.At the Immunity Challenge, Tyson outlasted Debbie to win the first Individual Immunity. After the challenge, Jeff told Joe to stay around so that the Survivor Medical Team could look at his infected leg. The doctor diagnosed that infection was serious and could spread to Joe's bones or blood, which could lead to amputation of his leg or loss of his life. Stephen, Tyson, and Coach decided to blindside Brendan and negate him potentially playing his Hidden Immunity Idol by splitting the Tribal Council vote with four votes against Brendan and three votes against Sierra.

The teams would have a row of eight team-colored ceramic tiles on frames belonging to them.  Playing in rounds, one member from each team would throw a metal ball at the other two team's tiles to try to break them.  When all eight tiles of a team were broken, the team would be out of the challenge.  The last team with an intact tile would win a whitewater rafting trip down the Rio Novo and a picnic of sandwiches, chicken wings, brownies, watermelon, and potato chips.The Reward Challenge was a nail-biter when the challenge came down to two partially broken tiles for the black team of Brendan, Debbie, and J.T versus the white team of Erinn, Sierra, and Stephen.  A final toss by Brendan knocked out the final white tile and his team won the challenge. They selected Stephen to go alone to Exile Island, per the rules post tribal merger.  Unlike most rewards in past seasons, the winning team went on their trip the next day instead of immediately after the completion of the challenge. On their picnic, Brendan talked to J.T. about going all the way to the finals together.  The next day, Brendan talked to Sierra and Taj about a plan to keep J.T. in the game and to vote out Coach, Erinn, and Tyson.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would be attached to a rope which is thread through three of obstacles, for which the castaways would have to climb under, over, or around.  The first three castaways to finish would move on to the next round.  The next round's challenge would be the same, but with a single obstacle three levels high.  The first castaway to complete the obstacle would win. A rendition of this challenge would later appear in Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains.The Immunity Challenge was won by Tyson for the second time in a row. Coach and Tyson conspired to split the Tribal Council vote four votes for Brendan and three votes for Sierra to protect against Brendan using his Hidden Immunity Idol.  Brendan wanted to finally reveal the secret Exile Island alliance to blindside Coach. Stephen and J.T. thought about following the Exile Island alliance.

The next morning, Sierra continued to plead for her life in the game, but Tyson ridiculed her and said that she would not be able to change the vote and she would be voted out next. \n\nReward Challenge: The castaways would be divided into two teams of four.  Two members at a time from each team would race across a field to retrieve a large puzzle board.  Once the pair returns, the other two teammates would retrieve another board.  Four boards would need to be retrieved.  Once retrieved, the boards would have to be arranged in a line so that the large holes were aligned like a grille to reveal seven vowels.  The revealed vowels and seven consonants that would be given to the team would need to be arranged to solve a four-word phrase.  The first team to solve the phrase (YOU'VE WON A FEAST) would win a trip to a local village for a feast of local food and a demonstration of Capoeira.At the Reward Challenge, the red team of Debbie, Erinn, J.T., and Tyson prevailed over the black team of Coach, Sierra, Stephen, and Taj.  Stephen was chosen to go to Exile Island for the second time in a row because the red team did not want to give Sierra the opportunity to find a supposed new Hidden Immunity Idol since Brendan took his with him when he was voted out.  At Exile Island, Stephen found the seventh clue to the original Hidden Immunity Idol, meaning no replacement Idol was put into play. Sierra continued lobbying Coach to give her a second chance to remain in the game, but Coach refused her pleas. After describing the Immunity Challenge, Jeff offered anyone who felt comfortable enough in the game to sit out and eat pizza for the duration of the challenge; Coach, J.T., and Stephen chose to eat. \n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would play a version of shuffleboard.  Each castaway would be given three pucks which they would try to slide closest to the target marked with an X.  The castaway whose puck ends up closest to the target would win. This challenge was originally from Survivor: The Amazon and Survivor: Vanuatu, and a rendition of this challenge would later appear in Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains.Debbie won the challenge with the last slide of the game by knocking away Sierra's puck.  Back at camp, Erinn pointed out to Stephen and Taj that there was an opportunity to vote out Tyson, the biggest perceived threat at the Immunity Challenges. Stephen agreed that this might be their only chance to take him out, so he convinced J.T. to blindside Tyson.

The questions would be posed to the group and the castaways would guess whose name was written most often.  Each time a castaway guesses the correct answer, they would get one chop at a rope assigned to another castaway.  After three chops, the rope would be released, which would smash an idol, removing that castaway from the challenge.  The last castaway whose idol is not smashed would win a trip to a natural spring and a home cooked, traditional Brazilian feast made by a local family.The Reward Challenge was won by Stephen, who selected fellow ex-Jalapaos Taj and J.T. to join him.  Stephen selected Erinn to go to Exile Island because he felt that he had a strong alliance with J.T, Taj, and Erinn and that they needed one of their alliance members at Exile Island to find any Hidden Immunity Idol, but there was no new clue to a new Hidden Immunity Idol.  While on their reward, J.T., Stephen, and Taj discussed strategy for the next Tribal Council, either voting out Debbie or Sierra.  Coach and Debbie tried to strongarm Sierra into rejoining the former Timbira alliance, but when she hesitated, they angrily turned on her.  Coach felt a line had been drawn in the sand and approached J.T. about what his plans were for the final four.  Coach lied to J.T. that it was Sierra who brought up bringing back the old Timbira alliance.  Meanwhile, Sierra told Stephen that it was Coach and Debbie who brought up the Timbira alliance. The differing stories made J.T. and Stephen suspicious of all three of them. \n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would toss a grappling hook to retrieve three bags.  The first three castaways to retrieve all of their bags would move on to the final round.  In the final round, the three would compete in a labyrinth game.

In an effort to show that she was not lying about her version of the potential reforming of the former Timbira alliance, Sierra confronted Coach and Debbie about what exactly happened between the three of them in front of the whole tribe.  Coach said that Debbie wanted to talk about a former Timbira alliance, Sierra got into Debbie's face, Debbie started to cry, and then he said that he did not want a Timbira alliance. Stephen and J.T. believed that Sierra's confrontation brought into the open Coach’s half-truths and Debbie's scheming and they considered voting Debbie out, but also thought that voting Sierra out would cause less drama in the future for the tribe.

However, Stephen was worried that she was just playing the game instead of wanting a real alliance. \n\nSurvivor Auction: Instead of a Reward Challenge, a Survivor Auction was held. Each castaway is given US$500. Castaways may not share any money or the item(s). The castaways must bid for the items in $20 increments. The auction will end without notice. Items bought include food and drinks and a video from home.On the last item up for bid, Jeff presented a Samsung Instinct loaded with a video message from loved ones at home and announced that the usual Survivor Auction rules would be suspended and that the castaways could pool their money in order to get one of the castaways to win the item. Everybody gave their remaining money to Taj so that she could win the item uncontested. At the very end of the video message, Taj's husband, Eddie George, said that he would see them back at camp.  After pointing out the last line in the video, Jeff told Taj that only Eddie would be back at camp, but if Taj offered to go to Exile Island where Eddie would join her, the other castaways' loved ones would be at the campsite.  She immediately accepted the offer. Back at camp, the castaways were joined by Coach’s assistant, Debbie's husband, Erinn's father, J.T.'s younger sister, and Stephen's brother. After the loved ones had left, the game resumed on the morning of day 32 with Debbie continuing to push her allegiance to J.T. and Stephen, even so far as promising to give the final Individual Immunity to one of them should she win it and they make it to the final three. The three continued to be suspicious of her promises, and after J.T. and Stephen told Erinn of this offer, Erinn said that Debbie had to go next. Coach, still uninformed of the voting out of Debbie, pushed the idea of voting out Taj to prevent the Hidden Immunity Idol from being played. \n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would have to go through an obstacle course of digging underneath a log, crossing a balance beam, and under a rope crawl.  The castaways would then run across a field to where a spinning series of ten mathematical symbols would be displayed.  The castaways would have to memorize the sequence of symbols, run back to starting line through the obstacles, and use the symbols in the correct order to solve a math equation.  The first castaway to solve the math problem correctly would win immunity.At the Immunity Challenge, Stephen was way behind the others as he stumbled off the balance beam several times, so he tried to remember all ten symbols in one pass, while the others needed multiple trips to try to remember the symbols.  Stephen's memory technique did not fail him and he was able to come from behind to win Individual Immunity for the first time.

The pole would be used to hook a sandbag which they castaways would swing to knock over three targets.  When all three targets are knocked over, a flag would be raised. The first castaway to raise their flag would win an overnight trip to the Governor's Retreat where the castaway would have a bed to sleep in, take a shower, and eat at a traditional Brazilian churrasco.The Reward Challenge was won by J.T. by a wide margin. He selected Stephen to go with him on the trip, and Coach to go to Exile Island.  After he was selected to go to Exile Island, Coach said that he welcomed the opportunity to test himself and would take the \"monastic approach\" on Exile by spending the time meditating without food or water.  This did not sit well with Erinn, who suspected that Coach was seeking an excuse for his inability to light a fire and prepare his meals. She called him out for trying to take the \"martyr approach\" and use his time at Exile Island as an excuse for not winning the next Immunity Challenge. While Stephen and J.T. enjoyed their reward, Erinn admitted to Taj that she felt a little guilty about what she said to Coach after the Reward Challenge, and was worried that what she said could cause J.T. and Stephen to vote her out before Coach. Taj reassured her that this was not the case, that their alliance was still strong. Coach did exactly what he said he would do on Exile Island, except for drinking some water, and was mentally refocused on the game.  While on their reward, J.T. and Stephen talked about voting Erinn out before Coach because of what she said to Coach.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would brace themselves with their arms between two walls while standing barefoot on two-foot pegs.  Every 15 minutes, the castaways would move down to smaller foot pegs.  When the castaways reached the third set of foot pegs, they would try to remain on them as long as they could.  The last castaway to remain on their pegs would win. A rendition of this challenge later appeared in Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains.The Immunity Challenge was won by J.T. when he outlasted Coach, who collapsed from the challenge due to back spasms.  Coach declined to have the Survivor Medical Team look at him as he said he feared that he would be pulled from the game for medical reasons.  Erinn and Taj were suspicious that Coach was playing up the sympathy card and that he did not want a medical exam because he knew that it would reveal that he was not hurt.  J.T. and Stephen told Coach that their alliance was good and that Erinn was going to be voted out, but Stephen was not sure who he would vote for.  At Tribal Council, the confrontation between Coach and Erinn at the Reward Challenge was again discussed.  Just before the vote, Coach recited a poem, which visibly annoyed the jury members.

The puzzle pieces would then be assembled into a web-shaped puzzle.  The first castaway to finish their puzzle would win.At the Immunity Challenge, J.T. got a large lead during the puzzle piece bag retrieval stage, Erinn made a huge comeback from behind during the puzzle assembly stage, but J.T. managed to finish his puzzle just in front of Erinn to win immunity.  Erinn pleaded her case to J.T. and Stephen that Taj was a threat for winning jury votes.  The men agreed that they would take each other to the Final Two no matter what but were undecided on if Erinn or Taj would be a greater threat at the next Immunity Challenge and with the jury.  At Tribal Council, the men decided to break up the Jalapao alliance that existed since very early in the game with a vote against Taj and she was blindsided by a vote of 3–1.\nOn day 38, Erinn and Stephen told each other that they had to win the Immunity Challenge as neither stood a very good chance against J.T. with the jury.  J.T. gave his word to Stephen that he would take him to the Final Two and Stephen likewise gave his word.  The day's tree mail told the Final Three to take the traditional journey honoring the castaways voted out before heading to their final Immunity Challenge. \n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would drop a ball into a metal chute.  The ball would travel down a spiraling metal track and exit out of one of two points.  The castaway would have to catch the ball and drop the ball back into the chute at the top.  Every few minutes, an additional ball would be added to the track until eight balls were simultaneously going around the track.  A turnstile gate in the middle of the track would rotate, causing the balls to alternate exiting out of the two exits.  If a ball exits the track and is not caught, the castaway would be eliminated from the challenge. The last castaway remaining would win. To make the challenge more difficult, each castaway would have one hand tied behind their backs.At the Immunity Challenge, Erinn was out first with three balls simultaneously going.  With four balls circling the track, Stephen bobbled and dropped a ball, giving J.T. his third Immunity Challenge win in a row.  Back at camp, even though Stephen lost the challenge, he felt a great relief that he would not have to decide who he had to take to the Final Two.  Erinn told J.T. that Stephen told her that he would take her to the Final Two over J.T. to ensure himself a victory with the jury.  When J.T. asked him, Stephen denied that he would have taken Erinn to the Final Two.  At the final Tribal Council, J.T. decided to stick with his alliance and promise to Stephen, voted against Erinn, and she became the final member of the jury.\nJ.T. and Stephen enjoyed the traditional Final Two breakfast that they had planned to attend since the very beginning of the game.  At the final Tribal Council, Brendan focused on Stephen's opening statement that he had grown personally in the game, asking Stephen and J.T. if personal growth was relevant and important to winning the game.  Erinn asked Stephen about his changing alliances between the Jalapao Three, the Exile Island alliance, and the Warrior alliance.  She asked J.T. why Stephen was the best player in the game.  Debbie questioned J.T. about if her first impression of him of being an honest person was correct or if lying and deception was his M.O. She asked Stephen that if he had been the one wearing the Individual Immunity necklace at the last Tribal Council, would he have taken Erinn or J.T. to the Final Two.  Coach asked J.T. and Stephen for examples of honesty and integrity during later stages of the game and being the noble warrior.  Sierra had no question to ask of Stephen.  She asked J.T. what he meant by taking the strongest players to the end as she called Stephen one of the weakest players in the game. Tyson asked J.T. if and why Stephen was an asset to him in getting to the Final Two.  Tyson asked for a response from Stephen about J.T.'s answer to Tyson's question.  Taj asked J.T. why, if it was so hard for him to write down Coach’s name at Tribal Council, it seemed so effortless for him to write down her name and why he thought it would be easy to lie to her.  She asked Stephen why he felt it was so important to blindside her and if he felt that she was that big of a threat in the game."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US18","season_name":"Survivor: Tocantins","season":18,"episode":15,"episode_title":"Reunion","episode_label":"Reunion","episode_date":"2009-05-17","episode_length":34,"viewers":11590000,"imdb_rating":7.5,"n_ratings":112,"episode_summary":"Months later, the castaways return to discuss the season with host Jeff Probst.

Mick and Russell S., the elected leaders for Foa Foa and Galu respectively, selected participants in the first Reward Challenge; as directed by Jeff, they chose who they believed to be the best swimmer, the strongest person, the most agile, and the smartest person on their tribes. \n\nReward Challenge: A designated swimmer would swim out into the ocean to retrieve a key and swim back. The swimmer would hand the key to the designated strong person to unlock a chain around two bundles of heavy logs. The logs would have to be carried to the next station where a designated agile person would use the log bundles to climb on top of a balance beam. The agile person would need to pull a second key along a rope twisted around the balance beam while remaining on top of the balance beam. At the final stage, a designated smart person would use the second key to unlock a bag of puzzle pieces and use them to assemble a statue. The first tribe to assemble their statue would win flint.When Foa Foa won the challenge, Jeff tossed maps to both tribes and sent them on their way. At Foa Foa, Mick downplayed his role of leader to stay \"under the radar\", believing that the leader always has a huge target on his head. Meanwhile, Russell H. quickly made secret \"dumbass girl alliances\" with Ashley, Betsy, Marisa, and Natalie; nevertheless, Betsy was suspicious and didn't trust him. At night in Foa Foa, Russell H. told a completely fabricated story to his tribe of his experience of Hurricane Katrina in his house in New Orleans, Louisiana; later, he emptied all the canteens and burned Jaison's socks. His strategy revolved around the idea that if he could control how his tribe felt, he could control how they think. Russell H.'s strategy began to affect the tribe as tribemates became more irritable.\n\nImmunity Challenge: Six members from each tribe would race across a series of three wooden A-frames carrying three coils of rope. At the end of the course, the six would use the rope to pull a heavy wooden crate across a ramp and up to the finish platform. The four remaining tribe members would disassemble the crate to use as puzzle pieces. The first tribe to solve the puzzle would win.When Foa Foa lost the Immunity Challenge, discussions of whom to vote out began when Mike talked about voting out the physically weakest: in his opinion, Ashley. Since Marisa was skeptical of Russell H.'s quickly-made alliance with her, the latter immediately targeted her for elimination. At Tribal Council, his plan to eliminate Marisa came together, and she was voted out."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US19","season_name":"Survivor: Samoa","season":19,"episode_number_overall":257,"episode":2,"episode_title":"Taking Candy From a Baby","episode_label":"Ep 2","episode_date":"2009-09-24","episode_length":43,"viewers":11660000,"imdb_rating":7.3,"n_ratings":107,"episode_summary":"Russell H. assumed a Hidden Immunity Idol was somewhere around camp and went searching for it. He located the idol, without the help of any clues, in the roots of a large tree. After taking the idol and hiding it in his underwear, he showed the idol to Jaison to create some trust between them.\n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: In a walled off arena, three members of each tribe would battle for control of three balls. Once a castaway gets control of a ball, they would pass the ball to three other tribe members standing on a platform who would attempt to throw the ball through the opposing tribe's basket at the other end of the arena. One point would be scored when a ball is made in the basket. After every point, the tribes would change who was in the arena and on the platform. The first tribe to score three points would win tribal Immunity and fishing gear.At the combined Reward and Immunity Challenge, after many dirty attacks during the game, Jeff stated that the next dirty attack would result in getting kicked out of the challenge. Moments later, Ben kicked Russell S. in his leg. Jeff called a time out and kicked Ben out of the challenge, resulting in Foa Foa being short one member. In the end, Galu triumphed over Foa Foa. When the challenge ended, Jeff announced a twist—the leader of the winning tribe would select one member of the tribe to accompany the losing tribe back to their camp and observe them through the next Tribal Council. When Russell S. selected Yasmin, Jeff gave her a note to be read in private. Jeff also asked Mike to stay so the Survivor Medical Team could examine him due to the hard hits he received. The Survivor Medical Team determined that he would be unable to continue and pulled him from the game. At Galu, Shambo went spearfishing with the tribe's new fishing gear; however, when she came back with no fish and a missing mouthpiece to the swim mask, Laura felt that Shambo had \"signed her own death warrant\". At Foa Foa, Yasmin, the observer, came off as rude to the Foa Foa members. Ben and Yasmin had a heated conversation involving racial controversy about Ben's \"cheap shot\".

Between the beach and crates would be a \"battle zone\" marked off by four flags. Within this zone, an opposing tribe member would try to prevent the two castaways from crossing the zone and reaching the crate. Once the two castaways crossed the zone, they would bring a crate back to the beach, and a second pair of castaways would go out to retrieve another crate. Once all four crates were retrieved, the crates would need to be stacked so that one color didn't show more than once on each column. The first tribe to complete the puzzle would win comfort items of pillows, candles, mats, beach towels, and a hammock.At the combined Reward and Immunity Challenge, Galu never lost their lead and won their third consecutive challenge. After the challenge was over, Jeff gave Russell S., Galu's leader, an option of trading the reward of comfort items for more functional items such as fishing gear, a pot, a lantern, and a tarp. Believing it would be delightful to the Galu women, Russell S. chose the comfort items. Many of the tribe's men disagreed with his choice. When Russell S. was also given the decision on whom to send as the observer to Foa Foa, he chose Shambo. Her visit with Foa Foa went great, and she began to feel more comfortable with them than Galu. When discussions arose about whom to vote out, Liz and Russell H., as well as Ben, gunned for Ashley, but Mick was unsure if he would agree with them or vote for Ben. Russell H. made an agreement with Mick that as long as the latter would not vote for him, Ben would be the next gone after Ashley. In an attempt to gain Mick's trust, Russell H. showed the Hidden Immunity Idol to him. At Tribal Council, Ben and Jaison voiced their disagreement about whether Ben's statements were racist.

Meanwhile, at Foa Foa's campsite, Russell H. pondered about changing his \"final two alliance\" from Jaison to Natalie, believing that he could tell the jury Natalie rode his coattails; Natalie, on the other and, felt confident that she would beat Russell H. in a final vote and privately stated that she would continue to play to her strengths, laying low and forming personal relationships. Upon arriving at the challenge site, the six selected castaways realized Jeff was nowhere to be seen. After some hesitation, the six made a scramble towards a treasure chest and a cage of chickens. In the treasure chest, they discovered instructions that they were to do the challenge on their own. \n\nReward Challenge: Three castaways from each tribe would play a game similar to bocce. A flag would be placed in the center of a circle. The castaways would take turns tossing three balls each at the flag. The tribe who throws a ball closest to the flag would win three chickens.Dave won the challenge with a last ricochet shot. When the victorious Galu trio returned to Galu with the reward, Shambo was assigned to watch over the chickens, but she mistakenly let one loose.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would race across a net run carrying wooden blocks to a platform. When all of the blocks were at the platform, they would need to be stacked into a tower. The castaways would then cross a rope bridge to a second platform where two nets would be tied together holding more wooden blocks. After the nets were untied, the blocks would have to be stacked into another tower. The first tribe to stack both towers would win.When Foa Foa broke Galu's Immunity Challenge win streak, deliberations began about how Tribal Council would go down. Brett and Kelly were both upset at Yasmin for doing nothing around camp, while Shambo and Yasmin wanted to vote out Monica because of her performance in the challenge.

The castaway would score one point if they were able to drink the whole glass. The challenge would not be a race and there was no time limit on getting the food item down. The first tribe to score five points would win steaks, sausages, and onions.At the Reward Challenge, the chance for Foa Foa to win rested on Ashley's shoulders. After much taunting from the Galu bench, she quit the challenge and lost for her tribe. Per the rules, Galu's leader, Russell S., chose Shambo as the observer for the second time, a decision which infuriated her; he selected Shambo because he felt she had to pay for the loss of the chicken. Upon reaching the opposing tribe's camp, Shambo shared all of the clues to the Hidden Immunity Idol with the Foa Foa members. Liz presumed Russell H. to have the Hidden Immunity Idol, however, and confronted him about it. He denied he had it and then threatened Liz for confronting him.\n\nImmunity Challenge: One man and one woman from each tribe would hold on to a rope that would suspend a net. The castaways from the other tribe would attempt to toss coconuts into the net which would weigh it down, making it more difficult to hold onto the rope. Should the net touch the ground, the castaway would be eliminated from the challenge. The castaway who held on to the rope the longest without letting the net touch the ground would win for their tribe.At the Immunity Challenge, Russell H. was the first to drop his net, and Liz dropped her net shortly afterward, losing the challenge for Foa Foa. Back at camp, rain had been pouring down for more than a day, and the Foa Foa members were forced to huddle together. Russell H. originally wanted Liz out because she had confronted him, but had second thoughts after seeing her strength in the Immunity Challenge. He also knew that Ashley was clearly the weakest link in the tribe. Foa Foa was unable to strategize, however, as the rain kept them together in the shelter.

The first tribe to finish the table maze would win pizza while observing the losing tribe at Tribal Council.At the Reward Challenge, Jeff announced that both tribes would be going to Tribal Council that night to vote somebody out of the game. Foa Foa selected Liz to be the guide with Jaison and Russell H. as cage-rollers, while Galu selected Laura to be the guide with Erik and Russell S. as cage-rollers. Towards the end of the cage-rolling stage, with Foa Foa in the lead, Russell S. became disoriented and struggled to make it to the puzzle table. When he collapsed at his station onto the puzzle table, Jeff called for a halt so the Survivor Medical Team could tend to Russell S. After examination, they found that he had dangerously low blood pressure which was even worse than Mike's injury was. Jeff officially called off the challenge and stated that although neither tribe would win the reward, both would still go to Tribal Council and vote somebody off. Moments later, as the medical team tried to sit him up, Russell S. blacked out again with his eyes open. The medical team tried to ask him if he remembered what just happened and told Jeff that Russell S.'s heart rate went from 97 (when they set him up) to 68. The medical team eventually decided it was time for him to be pulled from the game. Russell S. protested at first; saying his family depended on this and that he was just a little dehydrated. However Jeff said that after what he saw happen in front of him; including blacking out two times in front of him there would be no way Russell S. would stay in the game and that if he didn't get any help he would get worse. Feeling his frustration, Jeff reminded Russell S. that he was in great shape and had led a tribe that dominated, that there had been no sign earlier of him going home and he pushed himself until the end. Back at Foa Foa, the vote was between Natalie and Liz, while at Galu, the women targeted Shambo for being an outsider, while the men targeted Monica for being a liability in challenges. At Tribal Council, when the two tribes arrived at the site, Jeff explained Russell's condition, how he was removed from the game, and what had happened to Russell S. after the two tribes had been sent back to their respective camps. Jeff made a final announcement that due to the unprecedented circumstances of the incomplete challenge, including how big of an impact that Russell S. had on the Galu tribe, there would be no vote and nobody else would be going home.

Brett's win solidified the Foa Foa theory that he could quite possibly win again, forcing the alliance to vote out one of their own at the next Tribal Council. Russell H. told the rest that Monica was to be voted out first. Monica stirred the pot by informing Russell H. that Natalie had previously told her about Russell H.'s salary—she later corrected herself and stated it was rather Jaison who revealed the information. Monica's plot to anger Russell H. worked, and he went off to confront his alliance members about Monica's story; after confronting Brett and Natalie, he went to Jaison, who denied it because he had forgotten he told Brett and Monica those stories. Jaison felt nervous around Russell H. and believed the latter should be eliminated soon. When the castaways sat down at Tribal Council, Russell H. flaunted the Hidden Immunity Idol pulled out it out and placed it around his neck. Monica commented that she was busy stirring the pot and infuriating Russell H. with her rumors. She laughed about Russell H.'s open display of confidence in wearing his Idol. Because Brett was immune, Monica was the only vulnerable person outside of the core group of four Foa Foas plus Shambo, so Monica was sent home."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US19","season_name":"Survivor: Samoa","season":19,"episode_number_overall":269,"episode":14,"episode_title":"Two Brains Are Better Than One","episode_label":"Ep 14","episode_date":"2009-12-17","episode_length":43,"viewers":12460000,"imdb_rating":7.2,"n_ratings":99,"episode_summary":"In the tribe's shelter, Brett and Natalie felt a connection through their shared interest in religion as Brett recited verses of the Bible from memory.\n\nReward Challenge: Coconuts would be suspended in the air by intertwined ropes on a frame. The castaways would be split into two teams. One at a time, each castaway would select a rope to remove, which would cause coconuts to be released and drop to the ground. The first team to cause 100 coconuts to drop would lose. The winning team would receive a trip to a local village with a feast and overnight stay.At the Reward Challenge, the castaways drew stones to be team captains; when Natalie, one of the team captains, selected Brett first, Russell H. and Shambo were suspicious of an alliance that would need to be broken up immediately. This was partially brought up when Brett and Natalie joined hands as \"prayer warriors\" to help them through the challenge. After Jaison, Russell H., and Shambo won the challenge, they went on their reward trip. Jaison told Russell H he agreed to go to the top three together. The winning trio also discussed the possibility of a Brett–Natalie alliance and that they had to put a stop to it immediately by voting out Brett or Mick next. Back at camp, Brett suggested the three from the losing team create their own reward by spending the day at the beach hunting for snails. When Russell H. returned to camp, he talked with Natalie about her picking of Brett at the Reward Challenge. She reassured him that her and Russell H.'s \"final two alliance\" from early in the game was still strong.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would run out into a field to six different stations and count the number of objects (pigs, crabs, rocks, coconuts, octopuses, and fish) at each station. The count of the objects would be used to unlock a combination lock. The order of the numbers in the combination lock would be different for each castaway.

Jaison figured the former Foa Foa needed to be as strong as possible to prevent Brett from winning any further Immunity Challenges, and told Russell H. that Shambo would need to go next due to her poor performance in challenges. When Shambo approached the conversation, Jaison quickly scrambled off. Russell H. told Shambo, suspicious that Jaison was hiding something, that Jaison was upset, that he wanted to vote out Mick, and that Russell H. agreed with the vote. Mick was surprised when Russell H. told him that Shambo was getting on his nerves and she needed to go.

Russell H. talked to Natalie about how they could keep her in the game, warning her that if Brett were to win the next Immunity Challenge, she would be voted off to keep the strongest possible in the game in the hopes of voting off Brett. \n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would race across a rope net and a balance beam to retrieve a bag of puzzle pieces. Once back with the bag, they would climb up a steep wall to a platform where they would assemble the puzzle pieces. The first castaway to assemble their puzzle, the Survivor: Samoa logo, would win.Russell H. was again extremely confident going into the Immunity Challenge, but while he had an early lead, Brett came from behind during the puzzle assembly stage and pulled off his third immunity win in a row. Natalie and Russell H. again discussed what the plans were for Tribal Council. Russell H. wanted to keep Natalie around, as he felt that she would be seen by the jury members as \"riding his coattails\" and therefore not get any votes. Russell H. told Jaison that they had to keep Natalie and get rid of Mick to make it to the final three, which Jaison agreed with.  Russell H. told Mick a different story: Jaison could not beat Brett in anything, and voting off Jaison would give them a better chance at beating Brett. Mick agreed with the plan, believing that Jaison wasn't mentally in the game while Natalie was. With the vote split—Jaison and Mick agreeing to vote for each other—the power of who went home fell to Natalie and Russell H. They decided to vote against Jaison, and he was sent home blindsided by a vote of 4–1.\nUpon returning to camp, Brett knew that he had to win the next Immunity Challenge or he would be going home. Russell H. made a deal with Brett that should either of them win the next Immunity Challenge, that they would take each other to the final three. The final four took the traditional journey honoring the castaways voted out before heading to their Final Immunity Challenge.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would balance a wooden statue on top of a pole which they would have to keep upright holding the bottom of the pole. At regular intervals, an additional 1-foot (30-cm) section would be added to the end of the pole, making the pole longer and harder to balance. The last castaway still holding the statue up would win.The challenge came down to Brett and Russell H.; with the poles at 7 feet (2.1 m) long, Brett lost the balance on his pole and Russell H. won his first Individual Immunity.\nBrett figured that his only hope to remain in the game was the deal he made with Russell H.  Russell H. gloated about his challenge win to Mick and Natalie and said that he thought he had a great shot at the million dollars and was already rehearsing his jury speech.  Mick was concerned that Russell H. had some secret plan and that Mick was going home, but Natalie reassured him that the former Foa Foa would stick together.  Russell H. told Brett that he had a problem because he had made a deal with everybody to take them to the final three.  Russell H. told Brett that Brett was the kind of guy that Russell H. wanted his kids to marry and he wished he was like Brett when he was young.  Russell H. told Brett that Mick and Natalie would be voting against him and asked if Brett could win a fire starting challenge if Russell H. joined Brett in voting for Mick, forcing a tie. At Tribal Council, Mick and Natalie stated that there was no doubt in their mind that Brett was going home.  Jeff asked Russell H. if he could appreciate the competitor in Brett.  Russell H. answered that he respected the game and that Brett deserved to be in the final three.  Mick and Natalie emphasized that strategically, Russell H. had to vote out Brett.  In the end, Russell H. voted against Brett and he became the final jury member by a vote of 3–1.\nWith only three Foa Foa members left, Mick, Natalie, and Russell H. celebrated with the traditional Day 39 breakfast. Russell H. pressed Natalie over what she was going to say to the jury and he continued to gloat over how he had locked up the necessary jury votes. He even threatened to \"put her in the jury\", even though the jury stage of the game was over. The three then burned their encampment.  At the final Tribal Council, the final three made their opening statements.  Mick stated that he tried to play the game without overstepping his morals by trying not promise too much, overtly stomp on, lie, and mislead people, or treat them as pawns in the game.  Natalie focused on how she came into the game wanting to gain the confidence in going outside her comfort zone and that she appreciated everybody on the jury. Russell H. went over many of his big strategic moves throughout the game and claimed he played the game better than Mick or Natalie.\nThe time then came for the jury to ask their questions to the final three.  Jaison was up first, asking the three to tell the members of the jury who they really were and if they didn't, that he would.  All three told the jury what they did, but Jaison pointed out that both Natalie and Russell H. had made a lot of money before coming on Survivor, that Mick had the potential to make a lot of money, and that the jury should not focus who was broke, but on other criteria. Shambo took the opportunity to apologize to America for dismantling Galu and that she questioned that judgment call. She called Mick's overall game play \"feckless\", a word of which Mick did not know the meaning. She used the word \"coattail\" to describe Natalie, to which Natalie defended that she purposefully tried not to be aggressive in the game. Shambo then said that there was no way that Mick and Natalie would get her vote and said nothing to Russell H.  Brett asked nothing of Natalie or Russell H., but asked Mick what a \"bro date\" would be like with him to see to what level Mick invested in Brett as a human being. Kelly started with Natalie, telling her that she thought she was never on the field in the game and that Kelly always saw Natalie asking for help in the challenges, to which Natalie said that while she might not have been good in the challenges, but she gave 100% and that she got better as the game progressed.  She asked Russell H. if he lied, cheated, and stole in real life as he did in the game, to which Russell H. said that he did not and that \"honor, integrity, and loyalty\" was the most important thing to him, which she had a hard time believing. She said nothing to Mick.\nNext up was Monica, who asked Mick and Natalie why they felt the other two sitting beside them did not deserve to win.  Mick said that Natalie rode out her alignment with Russell H. throughout the game and that Russell H. was willing to lie, pit people against each other, mislead, and had a giant ego. Russell H. interrupted Mick's answer by stating that both Natalie and Mick didn't mind when Russell H. was being a snake and was congratulating him all the way. Monica appeared amused, said that she had heard enough, and sat down. Dave asked the three what they thought their chances were with the jury.  Mick thought it was 20–25%, Natalie 30–40%, and Russell H. said that his chances were a lot higher prior to Final Tribal Council but were now 55%.  Laura asked nothing of Natalie or Mick but asked Russell H. what he learned about her that enabled him to beat her, to which he generically stated that she was a threat. John asked nothing of Russell H. but asked Mick and Natalie for the \"hard sell\" of his vote. Mick repeated the theme of his opening statement that he was a stand-up guy, while Natalie said that she saw how the aggressive women in the game were getting voted out and that she adapted her game after that.\nErik asked no questions of the final three and instead made statements to the three.  He told Mick that he did nothing to deserve the title of being the tribe leader of Foa Foa. He told Russell H. that he played an unethical game and wondered if Russell H. got to the right place by behaving the wrong way and if Russell H. was proud of behaving in such a manner. Finally, Erik told Natalie that people would call her weak and undeserving, but asked why those characteristics were any less admirable than lying, cheating, and stealing. He went on to say that maybe she would call herself the less deserving of the title Sole Survivor, but that in an environment filled with \"arrogance\" (pointing to Russell H.) and \"delusional entitlement\" (pointing to Mick), that the person who might think she is the least deserving, could probably be the most.

On day 13, an intense rain storm drove NaOnka to break down emotionally and she considered quitting, but Alina and Chase convinced her to stick it out.\n\nImmunity Challenge: Three members from each tribe would be strapped to a large wheel.  Three other tribe members would spin the wheel, which would cause one strapped in castaway at a time to be dunked head first into water.  While under water, the castaway would take water in the mouth, which they would then spit into a tube.  Once the tube was filled, a ball would be released.  The ball would be used by two other tribe members to break five tiles.  The first tribe to break all five tiles would win.The Immunity Challenge was won by La Flor when Fabio and Jane came from behind during the tile breaking stage.  Espada voted to kill one of the chickens before they head off to Tribal Council, so they killed one of the hens.  Tyrone didn't want to kill the chicken and he was perceived to have taken a larger share of the chicken.  The tribe considered voting out NaOnka for potentially quitting and Tyrone for being too bossy, but the vote went against Tyrone at Tribal Council and he was voted off."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US21","season_name":"Survivor: Nicaragua","season":21,"episode_number_overall":290,"episode":6,"episode_title":"Worst Case Scenario","episode_label":"Ep 6","episode_date":"2010-10-20","episode_length":44,"viewers":12260000,"imdb_rating":6.9,"n_ratings":79,"episode_summary":"On day 15, Dan thought about quitting the game.

When Yve found out from Holly that Dan was thinking of quitting, Yve thought she could use that info to lobby the younger members of the Espada tribe in voting out Dan.  Over at La Flor, Brenda planned to flush out the Hidden Immunity Idol by splitting a 3–3 vote between Marty and Jill.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would use paddles to dig up three rope rings one at a time, tossed into a basket strapped to their lower backs, and returned to the start line.  The first tribe member to return all three rings to the start line would win.\nReward Challenge: The winners of the Immunity Challenge would compete against each other to toss three rope rings onto hooks on a board set a few feet away. The winner would receive a feast of chicken and beef kebabs to be eaten while listening to the other tribe's Tribal Council.When the tribes arrived for the Immunity Challenge, Jeff announced that they would not be playing for Tribal Immunity, but would be playing for Individual Immunity as both tribes would be going to Tribal Council that night.  Jeff then announced that the winners of the Individual Immunities would then compete in the Reward Challenge. Jill and Holly won Individual Immunity for La Flor and Espada, respectively; Jill then won reward for her tribe. Jill's immunity threw Brenda's plan into disarray and she came up with a new plan with Sash: to split the 3–3 vote between Marty and Kelly B., while telling Kelly B. that the vote would be split between Marty and Jane.  Marty worked on getting Fabio to join the older alliance by fabricating a story that he was a chess grandmaster and that as a child, he had beaten Guillermo Vilas, who actually played tennis and was not a chess grandmaster.  Sash told Fabio to vote for Marty, but Fabio had believed Marty's chess story and was conflicted about voting for Marty since he thought Marty was offering him an alliance and insight into his game.  At Espada, Yve continued her lobbying against Dan as being the weaker player in challenges and him thinking about quitting.  The younger members of the tribe were split between voting Dan or Yve as she was seen as the bigger threat within the game.  At La Flor's Tribal Council, the plan to flush the Hidden Immunity Idol did not work when Marty did not play it and the vote ended up being a tie 3–3–2 between Marty, Kelly B., and Brenda.  A second vote was taken with Marty and Kelly B. not voting and the others only voting for those two.  The vote swung against a very surprised Kelly B. and she was voted out.  The remaining La Flor members then moved to the side to enjoy their feast and observe Espada's Tribal Council.

The opposing tribe members would leap off a platform on one end of the pool into the water and try to throw a ball into a net on the far end.

With the La Flor loss, the younger group had another opportunity to flush the Hidden Immunity Idol and they planned to split the vote 3–2 between Marty and Jill.  If Marty played the Idol, the vote would be tied between Jill and whomever the Marty/Jill alliance would vote for and the younger group would then vote out Jill.

Sash sweetened the deal by telling Marty that if La Flor lost the next Immunity Challenge, Sash would return the Hidden Immunity Idol.

Before La Flor arrived, Alina lobbied for the six Espada members to stick together to the final six, but there was little enthusiasm for such an alliance.  Marty named the new tribe 'Libertad', the Spanish word for freedom.  After the merge, Brenda and NaOnka reestablished their alliance made before the tribal switch and told each other what had happened at each tribe.  On day 20, NaOnka made breakfast, but got angry when she ate last and got the smallest share.  Her anger prompted her to steal food and supplies which she hid in the jungle.  NaOnka shared her stolen items with Alina and told Alina that she was being targeted by the tribe.  When other members of the tribe noticed that items were missing, Holly said that she saw NaOnka take the flour jar and put in her bag.  NaOnka vehemently denied that she took the flour, claiming that she put it back, but did not explain why the flour was in her bag.  Eventually, NaOnka confessed to stealing the food after Alina and Chase convinced her that if she confessed, it would be better than continuing to lie. Even then, she tried to convince them that she stole it for the benefit of the tribe, and so that they wouldn't greedily eat all of it too soon. But most of the others, most prominently Marty, refused to believe this story and knew that she stole the food for her own benefit. The alliance of Brenda, Chase, Jane, and Sash decided to protect NaOnka by distancing themselves from her.  Sash admitted that it would be better strategically to bring NaOnka to the finale at this point because of her actions, as obviously, no one would vote for her to win, which would greatly benefit whoever else was in the finale with her.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would use two metal handles to hold a metal bar in tension above a tile.  The last man and woman to keep tension on the bar and keep it from breaking the tile would win.At the Immunity Challenge, Jane stayed in the challenge to continue to compete against the men even though she had already won the women's side of the challenge.  Fabio outlasted Chase to win the men's side.  Jane told the rest of the women that she stayed in the challenge to show up Marty.  The tribe was split between voting for Marty or Alina.  Sash asked his alliance to keep Marty around for one more Tribal Council so that he could keep his word on the deal that he made with Marty to give up the Hidden Immunity Idol.  At Tribal Council, Marty was very vocal that Jane was the biggest threat to win the game, even going so far as announcing that should Jane reach the Final Tribal Council that he would vote for her.

The teams would run an obstacle course of a hay stack, a rope crawl, a reed blocked pathway, a net crawl, and a brick wall.  Along the way of the course would be three stations where a key is suspended in the air on a metal spring.  The team would have to work together to reach the key and free it from the spring.  The first team to collect all three keys and unlock their team's flag would win a tour of the jungle canopy with zip-lining and a barbecue feast.At the Reward Challenge, the random draw for teams turned out to be men versus women. Since there were eleven castaways, Chase was the odd man out and did not participate.  However, he could select the team he thought would win, and if they won, he would join them on the reward.  He selected the women, but this turned out to be a poor choice when the men won the challenge.  On the reward, Marty continued his lobbying for his plan to vote out Jane.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would test their memory by having to memorize a series of symbols shown by Jeff.

Brenda and Sash talked over their swing votes by either joining the Marty or Jane blocs.  At Tribal Council, the discussion became heated when NaOnka made an expletive-filled rant towards Marty and Fabio, culminating with NaOnka giving Marty the finger.

Holly left Kelly S. out of the plan believing that she wouldn't switch because she was riding Brenda's coattail. A rain storm came and the tribe moved their three wooden chests around the fire in order to protect it before they headed off to the challenge.\n\nReward Challenge: The tribe would be split into two teams by school yard pick.  The teams would be given four barrels, two wood planks, and 10 feet (3.0 m) of rope that they would use to cross the beach without stepping on the sand.  If any team member steps onto the sand, the entire team would have to restart from the beginning.  The first team to reach the finish line would win a helicopter trip to the Cerro Negro volcano with volcano surfing and pizza, brownies, and soft drinks.At the Reward Challenge, the team of Chase, Fabio, Jane, Kelly S., and NaOnka cruised to victory.  While on their reward, NaOnka took Fabio aside and filled him in on the plan to vote out Brenda. Kelly S. looked on in surprise and questioned their actions to Chase but he didn't fill her in on the blindside against Brenda. When the losing team returned to camp, they discovered that the three chests had caught fire and burned down, taking with it their machetes and almost all of the tribe's food. After the winning team returned to camp, Chase told Brenda the entire plan to vote her out, but Brenda shrugged it off. Chase again lobbied to vote out Benry to NaOnka, but NaOnka would not budge and she then told Benry, Jane, and Holly that Chase could not be trusted, since he had told Brenda about their plan.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would stand on small platforms and hang on to a rope while leaning backwards over a pool of water.

NaOnka told Sash about the plan to vote out Brenda and he was then torn between giving the Hidden Immunity Idol to Brenda or letting the plan go through.  At Tribal Council, Brenda called out NaOnka for splitting up the original alliance, while NaOnka tried to deflect the blame onto Chase.

Chase thought that the core alliance was himself, Holly, Jane, and NaOnka. On Day 28, the rain returned with a vengeance and made camp life miserable. NaOnka and Kelly S. had doubts that they could continue in the game, as they were both exhausted by the conditions of the weather. NaOnka gave her Hidden Immunity Idol to Chase, and with NaOnka thinking about quitting, the alliance of Chase, Holly and Jane brought in Sash, but he preferred that NaOnka and Kelly S. stayed in the game and considered joining Benry, Dan, and Fabio in an alliance.\n\nReward Challenge: The tribe would be divided into two teams by school yard pick.  The teams would be tethered together and would untie from a table an 8-foot (2.4 m) stuffed dummy named \"Gulliver\" after the novel Gulliver's Travels.

The first team to cross the finish line would win a viewing of the upcoming film of the titular novel, hot dogs, nachos, popcorn, candy, and drinks.At the Reward Challenge, Dan was left out of the challenge from the school yard pick.

The choice turned out to be a good one as the four won the closely fought challenge. As soon as the challenge ended, NaOnka announced that she wanted to quit the game. A stunned Jeff asked if anybody else wanted to quit and Kelly S. said that she did. Jeff told the two women that they should think about if they really wanted to quit and that the tribe would meet at Tribal Council that night to sort out the matter. Jeff then offered a tarp and a can of rice to replace the ones lost in the camp fire if one of the winning team members would forgo their reward, to which Holly stepped up and volunteered. Benry tried to make NaOnka step up and volunteer since she had wanted to quit, but NaOnka remained silent. Benry, Chase, Dan, and NaOnka went off to their reward. During the reward, NaOnka gave her hidden immunity idol to Chase because she wanted to quit. Back at camp, Holly tried to convince Kelly S. to stay in the game. Later that night, the five who didn't go on the reward arrived at Tribal Council followed a short time later by the four who did and the members of the jury. Jeff and the tribe discussed what it took to keep the desire to stay in the game and why NaOnka and Kelly S. were considering to quit. Jeff then asked NaOnka if she did want to quit and she replied that she did. Kelly S. was asked the same question and she also stated she wanted to quit. Jeff asked the two women what should happen to their torches. They asked for them to be snuffed as per usual practice, which Jeff agreed to, but then said that the snuffed torches would remain in the Tribal Council area as a reminder to the two women that while they served on the jury, they had quit the game instead of getting voted out.

While Chase and the women were on their reward, Sash talked to the remaining three guys about joining their alliance, but Dan and Benry were leery about Sash's true alliances and did not trust him.  On the reward, Chase realized that he made a major mistake by not taking Sash on the reward and that he would have to regain Sash's trust.  In order to do so, Chase and Holly came up with a plan to tell Sash that the two would vote out Jane and take Sash to the final three.  Chase also told Benry that Jane would not make it to the final three, to which Benry said that was fine and he was willing to vote out Fabio.  Chase and Holly told Sash that leaving him behind was really a sign of trust in him, since they figured that he was loyal to them and that it would be safe to leave him alone with the Benry/Dan/Fabio alliance.

After Jeff welcomed the group to the game, he announced that two additional players would be joining them, in which Rob and Russell then arrived in a second helicopter. Jeff went over the two's history in the game and then the two drew for tribes. Rob drew the orange Ometepe tribe buff, while Russell drew the purple Zapatera tribe buff. Jeff then announced the new twist of Survivor, which was Redemption Island. At Ometepe, Rob caught Kristina looking for a clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol. Rob then talked to Phillip about keeping an eye out for a woman's alliance on the tribe, since the women outnumbered the men 5–4. However, Phillip was uneasy with the idea and approached Kristina about forming an alliance and siding with the women. Over at Zapatera, Russell made his usual early game move and made an alliance with Stephanie, and talked about taking her to the merge. On Day 3, Kristina went on a hunt for the Hidden Immunity Idol by herself without any clues and actually managed to find it.  Francesca, Kristina, and Phillip then formed an alliance, but Phillip annoyed the women with his aggressive questioning about whom to vote off at Tribal Council.\n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: The tribes would push four blocks along a track which would form a set of stairs to the first level of a temple. The tribe would race to the first level where one tribe member would cut a series of ropes which would release a second set of stairs to the top level of the temple. The tribe would then race to the top level of the temple where there would be a block puzzle. The first tribe to complete their puzzle would win flint and immunity.The first combined Immunity/Reward Challenge was won by Zapatera, when Ometepe fell behind early. They managed to catch up, but at the puzzle part of the challenge they fell behind and lost. After the challenge, Kristina told Francesca and Phillip that she had the Hidden Immunity Idol, and she told Francesca of her plan to blindside Rob by getting the other three Ometepe women to vote for Kristina, while their three person alliance votes for Rob. Francesca was concerned that it was too early to vote out Rob, and that they did not have the numbers to stay in the game long-term. Francesca also wanted to vote out Natalie, as she was seen as the weakest link of the tribe. Rob told the other Ometepe members (Andrea, Ashley, Grant, Matt, and Natalie), that he was concerned that the Francesca/Kristina/Phillip alliance may have already found a Hidden Immunity Idol and they should split their vote between Francesca and Kristina.\nAt Tribal Council, the Francesca/Kristina/Phillip alliance imploded when Francesca openly said that Rob would not be voted out. This enraged Phillip, who immediately responded and said that Francesca told him to vote for Rob. This angered both Francesca and Kristina, and they decided to change their votes to Phillip, both vehemently denied that they were planning to vote out Rob. Phillip openly voiced that he would be voting for Francesca and announced that Kristina had the Hidden Immunity Idol, shocking everyone else on the tribe and silently infuriating Francesca and Kristina. Kristina admitted that she did have the Idol, but she, along with Francesca, still denied that their plan was to vote out Rob, but instead she would be voting for Natalie, even though she did tell Phillip that she was voting for Rob. Jeff asked Rob whose story he believed. Rob said that, while Phillip was adamant in defending his story, Francesca denied it with equal energy. However, Kristina did not defend herself. Rob asked Kristina to show him the Idol just to confirm that she had it. Upon seeing it, he asked her to give him the Idol, declaring that she would stay in the game if she handed it over and that doing so would show that Kristina was telling the truth, but Kristina said she could not hand it over. When the voting came, the alliance of six kept to their plan and split their votes between Francesca and Kristina. With Phillip's flip to the majority, Francesca was voted out and became the first castaway to go to Redemption Island. After Francesca left for Redemption Island, Jeff said that there would be a flint at Ometepe's campsite."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US22","season_name":"Survivor: Redemption Island","season":22,"episode_number_overall":301,"episode":2,"episode_title":"You Own My Vote","episode_label":"Ep 2","episode_date":"2011-02-23","episode_length":44,"viewers":10932000,"imdb_rating":7,"n_ratings":96,"episode_summary":"After Ometepe returned to camp from Tribal Council, Phillip felt betrayed by Francesca and swore his loyalty to Rob, while Rob plotted with his alliance to vote out Phillip next.

Russell then went on his typical Hidden Immunity Idol hunt, but was beaten to it by Ralph who happened to stumble upon the idol while picking up rocks.\n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: One at a time, a castaway would swim across a pool, climb up a tower, and then jump off the tower to smash a tile. The smashed tile would release a key which the castaway would retrieve. Once five keys were retrieved, one castaway would use the keys to unlock a box that contained a ball.

After Zapatera had won, Matt shook the hands of several of the Zapatera tribe members, which angered Rob. Russell picked up Zapatera's reward as he knew there would be a clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol within it. He tried to take the clue without anybody noticing, but Ralph did and told the rest of the tribe. Mike and Ralph confronted Russell about the clue, but Russell denied that he had it even though he had already shown it to his alliance.

Back at Ometepe, Rob talked to Andrea and tried to reassure her that she was still part of his alliance, but Andrea did not believe him and wanted to find a way to mix things up in the future. Over at Zapatera, Russell's alliance could not find the Hidden Immunity Idol, so they decided to feign like they did have one by having Stephanie constantly carry around her bag, giving the impression that an idol was in her purse. David, Mike, Ralph, Sarita, and Steve all agreed to lose the next challenge on purpose in order to vote out Russell. Julie was reluctant about this plan, as she did not want to give any momentum to Ometepe and she thought she could handle Russell.\n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: Three members from each tribe would be strapped to a large wheel. Three other tribe members would spin the wheel, which would cause one strapped in castaway at a time to be dunked head first into water.

After the loss, Russell was very emotional, but he regained his composure and let loose on his former tribe by getting Ralph to say that he had a Hidden Immunity Idol and telling Kristina and Phillip that Sarita, Mike, and Steve were in charge of their tribe. While Kristina and Phillip were off at the Redemption Island, Rob came up with a ruse to distract the rest of the tribe so that he could search for the Hidden Immunity Idol. The ruse worked and Rob had the time to successfully find the idol. When Kristina and Phillip returned to camp, Phillip thought he could use Russell's information about Zapatera's alliances and the Hidden Immunity Idol as leverage against Rob and Grant to allow Kristina to remain in the game. However, the ploy failed as Rob and Grant distrusted Phillip even more after his revelation.\n\nReward/Immunity Challenge:  The tribes would send out one tribe member at a time to complete tasks involving tools.

However, Grant and the girls were leaning towards voting out Phillip as he was getting on their last nerves. When Phillip asked Rob whom he should vote for at Tribal Rob told him Kristina, Phillip thought Rob went back on his word about keeping Kristina in the game and decided that he needed to make a move at Tribal Council to keep himself in the game.

The next day at Zapatera, Sarita began to irritate her tribe with an issue regarding her tooth. David told Stephanie that in order to remain in the game, she had to try to break up the alliance and get them to vote for Sarita.

Mike saw Matt as the linchpin vote at Tribal Council and approached him about joining the former Zapatera tribe along with Andrea. Mike promised Matt to go to the final four with him, even at the expense of his own tribe and the use of the Hidden Immunity Idol.

Mike continued to work on getting Matt to flip even so far as writing a note to Matt promising him final three if he voted for Grant. Matt showed the note to Andrea. Rob took Andrea aside to tell her that the vote was going against Matt. Andrea was torn whether to keep Matt or be the deciding vote to eliminate Grant instead, as it would mean betraying 2 of her 3 main allies- Grant and Rob, and she was now unsure after Matt had revealed their prior plans to Rob whether she could trust Matt moving forward, and also unsure what her situation would then become with Matt having already gone back on his idea of them switching to the Zapatera side.  She also considered telling Matt about the situation but did not. Before the Tribal Council votes were read, Ralph stepped up and told Jeff that he wanted to play the Hidden Immunity Idol on Mike.

Phillip had another premonition from his great-great-grandfather that he would find the shorts that Julie buried and after looking, he did indeed find them.\n\nRedemption Island Duel: The three castaways would play a variation of shuffleboard. The castaways would be given three pucks which they would slide across a board and past various obstacles. The first two castaways to have all three of their pucks come to rest touching the end zone would remain in the game.Over on Redemption Island, Matt was struggling with remaining focused on the game, but his faith pulled him through to a victory along with Mike in the second three-way Redemption Island Duel. Grant suggested to Rob that Andrea be the first of the Ometepe alliance to be voted out as he was concerned that she had some sympathy for voting out Matt.\n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: The castaways would compete in a logrolling contest. The castaways would match up against another tribe member. The castaway who stays on the log the longest would advance to the next round. In the next round, the remaining four would again compete head-to-head in a single elimination. In the final, the last castaway standing on the log would win chocolate cake and milk and immunity.After Jeff described the Reward/Immunity Challenge, he held up a wrapped package and announced that there would be a twist after the challenge. In the first round of the challenge, Grant defeated Rob, Ashley defeated Andrea, Ralph defeated Steve, and Phillip defeated Natalie. In the second round, Grant defeated Ashley and Ralph defeated Phillip. Grant won the last round to take his second Individual Immunity. Jeff then said that Grant could choose two people to share his reward and he selected Rob and Andrea. Grant wanted Andrea to feel secure in the final 3 promise she thought she had with Rob and Grant, and be unaware of her lower position in the Ometepe alliance. Jeff gave the wrapped package to the tribe, told them not to unwrap it and to bring it to the night's Tribal Council. The castaways speculated about the wrapped package, thinking it was a set of cards and that they might have to vote out a second person at the upcoming Tribal Council. Rob decided that Ralph would be voted out next at Tribal Council because he was still a threat in the game while he thought Steve had already given up. Rob informed Ashley and Natalie about his and Grant's concerns about Andrea's loyalties and the two girls agreed to vote for Andrea should they have to vote out two people at Tribal Council. Steve approached Ashley and Natalie about having the three girls of the Ometepe alliance blindside Rob, but Ashley and Natalie declined because they wanted Andrea out of the game. When the two girls told Rob about Steve's offer, Rob reassessed Steve's desire to stay in the game and considered voting out Steve ahead of Andrea. At Tribal Council, Steve made one last play to the girls to blindside Rob, but when the vote came, the girls did not flip and Ralph was sent to Redemption Island.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would test their memory by having to memorize a series of symbols shown by Jeff. The castaways would have to show back the symbols in order. If they showed the wrong symbol, they would be out of the challenge. The last castaway to show all of the correct symbols would win immunity.As soon as Ralph departed Tribal Council, Jeff announced that the tribe could unwrap the mystery package. The package contained a set of cards that announced that the tribe would immediately compete in an Immunity Challenge and then vote out a member of the tribe.

The four on Redemption Island also received a similar phone announcing the duel and video messages from their loved ones. When the castaways arrived at the Redemption Island Duel, Jeff took the phones back and then announced that the first winner of the Duel would get to spend time with their loved one in person. Mike was the first person to win at the duel and won a visit from his mother, Jane. Matt and Ralph finished the duel in second and third place to continue in the game. When Mike's mother arrived at the Redemption Island Arena, Jeff gave Mike three choices: he could take the visit from his mother, he could opt to forgo the visit with his mother and instead give Matt's brother, Burton and Ralph's friend, Ronnie for a visit, or he could forgo the visit with his mother and give the Ometepe Six a visit from their loved ones. All of the loved ones entered the Redemption Island Arena while Mike made his decision. Mike took inspiration from the Bible to give the most good to the most people and chose to give visits to the Ometepe Six (Andrea's dad, Royal; Ashley's mom, Teri; Grant's brother-in-law, Steve; Natalie's mom, Tracie; Phillip's sister, Tracy; and Rob's sister, Heather). The Ometepe Six then headed back to camp to spend the afternoon with their loved ones. Back at the Redemption Island campsite, Ralph was upset at Mike's decision while Matt said he couldn't have made the same decision but also admired Mike for being able to. Mike claimed that the decision was not strategic, but just the right thing to do.  Jeff though openly questioned if Mike's decision was to increase his chances of winning jury votes, especially from the Ometepe side, should he reach the end. \n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would have to race to assemble eighteen puzzle steps in a staircase. The castaways could only carry one puzzle step at a time up the staircase and had to place the steps in order from bottom to top. The first castaway to correctly place all eighteen steps and reach the top of the staircase would win immunity.On day 32, Rob won the exhausting Immunity Challenge to win his second Individual Immunity in a row. The tribe decided to blindside Andrea at Tribal Council. Before Tribal Council, Phillip complained about a tangled fishing net. He also tore down part of the roof of the Zapatera part of the shelter and threw it in the fire. He did this to reinforce his strategy of playing the villain/annoyance-of-the-tribe in order to be seen as being somebody easy to defeat at the Final Tribal Council.

Once clear of the maze, the handle would be used to smash open a box that contained a bag of puzzle pieces. The first three castaways to solve the word puzzle would remain in the game.Over at Redemption Island, Andrea and Matt argued over Andrea's blindside of Matt. Matt argued Andrea had betrayed him again which was a slap in the face given how close they had become, while Andrea argued she had been willing to work with Matt even over Rob, until he had betrayed her trust when he revealed to Rob how she and he had considered flipping sides to the Zaps with Matt, and unnecessarily doing so even after Matt changed those plans. She also blamed Matt's stupidity as causing Rob's distrust in her, and for her position at the bottom of her Ometepe alliance.  On day 33, the Redemption Island Duel was held with Mike, Matt, and Andrea finishing the puzzle ahead of Ralph after he blew a huge lead from the maze stage when he struggled with the word puzzle. The next day, Rob and Grant discussed voting out Ashley. Meanwhile, Phillip and the girls argued over food. Rob was upset Phillip was drawing the girls closer when he wanted to pull them apart. Rob reassured Natalie that he would take her to the end. Back at camp Ashley started to worry about her position in the game, telling Natalie she thought Rob would vote one of them off at the end to make sure Grant was in the final 3. Ashley thought about making a big game move and approached Rob about voting off Grant.  She argued to Rob that neither she or Rob could beat Grant in a jury vote, and that with Mike or Matt expected to be the one to return from Redemption Island, having 2 off Grant, Mike, Matt around would leave the others no chance to win any remaining immunity challenges. Rob told Ashley he would consider it, but then told Grant about Ashley's proposal and they agreed to vote out Ashley next.\n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: With one arm tied behind their backs, the castaways would work to solve a three section puzzle in the shape of a fish skeleton. The castaways would link together fish hooks to retrieve a bag of puzzle pieces that would complete one of the three sections.

The castaways would attempt to keep the vase balanced on the end with their foot still on the seesaw. The last castaway to have their vase balanced on the end of the seesaw would win.Day 36 saw the final Redemption Island Duel. The castaways lasted 40 minutes before Grant's vase tipped over and he became the fifth jury member. After the one-hour mark, Matt's vase tipped off the board and he became the sixth jury member after surviving ten duels and 29 days on Redemption Island. The Duel came down to Andrea and Mike, with Mike being unable to keep his vase balanced, allowing Andrea to win and re-enter the game. When Andrea returned to camp, she started to scramble to remain in the game by making up a story to Ashley and Natalie that Ralph, Matt, and Mike said they would vote for Phillip at the final Tribal Council, which was a complete lie but seemed to have the girls worried.  Ashley thought Andrea might join her and Natalie in voting out Phillip or Rob.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would race along a balance beam to collect a series of bags containing 100 numbered tiles. The first castaway to place their tiles on a board in order from one to one hundred would win immunity.At the Immunity Challenge, Ashley edged out Andrea and Rob to win. When the castaways returned to camp, Rob overtly took Ashley, Natalie, and Phillip aside to tell them that Andrea had to be voted off.  In a private confessional he said voting out Andrea instead of Phillip or Natalie (or himself) was a no brainer from his perspective, as she had worked hard around camp, performed admirably in challenges, and had strong connections and had made no enemies on the jury. Ashley asked Natalie about Rob's plan for the subsequent vote to make sure that the next to go after Andrea would be Phillip. Natalie was concerned about Rob keeping Phillip, but promised to Ashley that her next vote would go against Phillip. Phillip openly reported on the girl's discussions, but then took off for a private conversation with Rob.  While the guys were gone, Andrea again lobbied the two other girls in voting out Rob. At Tribal Council, Andrea again lobbied the girls to take control of the game. Rob though pointed out to the others that Andrea was also a huge threat, and proved it again today, and too well liked by jury members to want to take to the end. Andrea then countered by saying the jury were not made up of dummies, and Rob would be an easy choice to win should he be allowed to reach the end, as he had controlled things, while Natalie and Ashley had just followed Rob's orders.  Before the votes were read, Rob pulled out the Hidden Immunity Idol and played it. However, the Idol was not needed as Ashley and Natalie stayed loyal to Rob and voted out Andrea.  At the Reunion show Natalie and Ashley claimed to have known about the Idol, and with this being the last time it could be played, knowing Rob almost certainly was playing it, so possibly voting him out instead of Andrea would have been pointless.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would race through a maze to collect four bags of puzzle pieces at four different stations. Once all four bags were collected, the castaways would race to the top of a pyramid and assemble a word puzzle. The first castaway to correctly solve the puzzle would win immunity.When the castaways returned to camp after Tribal Council, Rob promised the girls that they would go to the final three together. At the Immunity Challenge, Ashley and Rob finished the maze stage, but were stumped by the difficult puzzle. In the end, Rob figured out the puzzle spelled out \"Only You Are Safe\" to win the final Individual Immunity; guaranteeing him a spot in the final Tribal Council. After the challenge, Rob again told the girls that they were safe and to not tell Phillip about their plans. Ashley asked Natalie to tell her if Rob were to change his plans and Natalie promised that she would. Rob told Phillip that Ashley was going home. Rob took Natalie aside try to convince her to vote against Ashley by pointing out that Ashley may have made a connection with the former Zapatera members on the jury and that she was a threat. Ashley again asked Natalie if Rob had said anything about voting against her, but Natalie lied and said that nothing was going on. At Tribal Council, Natalie found herself in a similar predicament Rob had been in with Grant and Natalie last Tribal Council, torn between her friendship with Ashley and her loyalty to Rob. Ashley made the mistake when probed by Jeff by openly stating she had a much better chance of winning the game than either Natalie or Phillip, and could actually beat Rob, but felt she should be taken to the finals anyway due to her game long loyalty. In the end, Natalie sided with Rob by voting for her instead of Phillip to avoid a tie and fire-making challenge, and Ashley became the final member of the jury.\nAt the final Tribal Council, Philip and Natalie both emphasized their loyalty to Rob, with Phillip going so far as to tell the jury that Rob was the mastermind of their entire plan, while he implemented it.[36] The jury was critical of Natalie for her dependence on Rob and her blindside vote for Ashley. Several jury members emphasized their lack of respect for Phillip, who repeatedly grew hostile and confrontational.

Coach and Ozzy disembarked. To determine which tribes the two returnees would join, each randomly drew a paint-filled egg. Crushing their eggs, Coach discovered his was filled with blue paint, meaning he would join Upolu; likewise, the paint inside Ozzy's egg was red, meaning he would join Savaii.  While all of Savaii was openly pleased that Ozzy was part of their tribe, Coach's welcome to Upolu was cold, with only Edna showing him kindness.  Amidst the ceremony, John requested that Jeff call him by his last name, Cochran, in the vein of past castaways that Jeff was fond of.\n\nReward challenge: Coach and Ozzy would represent their tribes by climbing a 12-foot (3.7 m) pole to retrieve a wooden turtle.  They would then have to dig themselves under a log.  Finally, they would solve a six-level Tower of Hanoi puzzle with the turtle as the top piece to win taro and flint.Jeff explained that Redemption Island was in play and that a reward challenge would begin immediately between Coach and Ozzy representing their tribes. They both struggled with the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, requesting help from their tribes. Savaii's assistance was pivotal and Ozzy took the win. When Upolu arrived at their campsite, Coach tried to charm his tribe and overcome his cold greeting.  Meanwhile, Christine went off to look for the hidden immunity idol, which roused suspicion among her teammates. Brandon found himself struggling with a secret, being the nephew of the infamous Russell Hantz -- a fact which would be a daunting challenge for Brandon to hide for long as he had the words \"Little Hantz\" tattooed on his back and arm. During a nighttime conversation, Coach formed an impromptu alliance with Albert, Brandon, Rick, and Sophie. Over at Savaii, Mark asked to be called \"Papa Bear\", which the rest of his tribe thought was odd but accepted nonetheless. On day 2, Dawn had a minor emotional breakdown, which concerned Papa Bear and Ozzy.\n\nImmunity challenge: The tribes would race through an obstacle course of zigzagging pathways, through a web of strung up coconuts, and over a 10-foot (3.0 m) wall.  One tribe member would then dig up a machete and use it to cut five ropes which would release a bin of coconuts.  Three tribe members would then shoot the coconuts through a hoop into a net.  When enough coconuts were shot into the net, their combined weight would raise a flag.  The first tribe to raise their flag would win.The first immunity challenge was won by Upolu in a close match. In addition to tribal immunity, Upolu received flint and was told that a clue to the hidden immunity idol was hidden at their campsite.  When Savaii returned to camp, Semhar and Jim had an argument about Semhar's effort and Jim's criticism at the immunity challenge. Most of the tribe wanted to vote out Semhar due to her failure at the coconut throwing stage of the challenge, for which she had volunteered. Ozzy, however, having bonded with Semhar, suggested that the tribe consider voting out Cochran for being physically inept. Jim was suspicious about Ozzy's reasons for keeping Semhar in the game. Ozzy told Semhar that she needed to lobby the others in voting out Cochran. Jim told Cochran about Ozzy's suggestion and Cochran became paranoid that he would be voted out. At Tribal Council, the tribe debated if Semhar or Cochran was to remain in the tribe.  When the vote came, the tribe decided to vote out Semhar unanimously and she became the first resident of Redemption Island."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US23","season_name":"Survivor: South Pacific","season":23,"episode_number_overall":315,"episode":2,"episode_title":"He Has Demons","episode_label":"Ep 2","episode_date":"2011-09-21","episode_length":43,"viewers":10460000,"imdb_rating":7.3,"n_ratings":88,"episode_summary":"On Redemption Island, Semhar recited poetry to comfort herself over feeling abandoned by her tribe. At Upolu, Coach, not having forgotten Edna's earlier kindness toward him, allowed her to join his alliance, albeit as a sixth, outlying member. In keeping his relation to Russell Hantz a secret and with guilt eating at him, Brandon revealed his secret to Coach and asked him to keep it to himself. Brandon gave his word that he would stick with Coach and their alliance. Christine found the clue to the whereabouts of the hidden immunity idol, but her persistent efforts to find the idol further alienated her from the rest of the tribe. Brandon continued to project sinister and sordid motivations in Mikayla's simple camp activities and felt very uncomfortable around her, saying that she reminded him of Parvati Shallow.  Because of this, Brandon wanted Mikayla voted out as soon as possible. At Savaii, Ozzy used his past Survivor experience and looked for things out of place and discovered the hidden immunity idol. Jim put forth a \"3 plus 2\" alliance plan of himself, Keith, and Ozzy as a core alliance with Elyse and Whitney as the \"plus 2\".\n\nReward/Immunity challenge: Four members from each tribe would unwind ribbons from a maypole to release a set of keys. One of the four would then use the keys to free four other tribemates. Those four tribemates would then push crates around a platform to clear the way for a large crate to pass under a pole. The entire tribe would then carry the large crate to a finish platform. The first tribe to have their large crate onto the finish platform would win pillows, blankets, a hammock, a mat, and immunity.At the combined reward/immunity challenge, the men of Upolu blew a huge lead going into the crate stage of the challenge, allowing Savaii to come from behind and win the challenge. Back at camp, most of the core Upolu alliance had settled on targeting the outsider of the tribe, Christine, but were also wary about the possibility of her having found a hidden immunity idol -- so Coach suggested to his alliance that they protect themselves by splitting their votes between Christine and her only ally, Stacey. Brandon, however, expressed his desire to vote out Mikayla instead. Coach, trying to maintain control of the alliance, insisted that they stick to the plan of splitting the vote. Still wanting to eliminate Mikayla first, Brandon lied to Coach and told him that Christine and Stacey would vote for Mikayla. At Tribal Council, Coach confronted Christine and Stacey about their votes.  Christine and Stacey denied they had ever said they would vote for Mikayla.  When they asked who Coach had heard that from, Coach refused to say until Brandon confessed to telling the two women to vote against Mikayla. When the vote came, the alliance of six along with Mikayla followed Coach's plan and split their vote, casting four against Christine and three against Stacey.

At regular intervals, the player would add an additional section to the bottom of the pole, making the pole longer and harder to balance. The last castaway still holding the totem up would win.Before the duel started, Semhar recited more poetry to calm herself, but it did not help and she lost to Christine. On day 7 at Upolu, Brandon felt guilty about lying to his tribe during his push to vote out Mikayla. He finally told them the truth about his family, displayed his tattoos and apologized for continuing to lie to them. In private, Brandon and Mikayla discussed why he wanted to vote her out. After Brandon felt threatened by her demeanor, he gathered the rest of the tribe and told them all that he was very upset at Mikayla's approach, that she did not appear to have much of an alliance, and to keep him out of all tribal drama. Coach was concerned that Brandon's outburst would cause friction within the tribe and his alliance. At Savaii, Ozzy decided that he had to trust somebody with the knowledge of his hidden immunity idol discovery and he decided upon telling Keith. Keith then told Whitney in order to gain her trust.\n\nReward/Immunity challenge: A tribe member would race across a floating bridge carrying a bodyboard attached to a rope. The tribe member would grab a bag containing a banner that would form part of their tribe's flag. They would then ride the bodyboard back to shore as it was winched in by the four members of their tribe. Five bundles would need to be winched to the beach in this manner. Two tribe members would then use grappling hooks from the top of a wall to retrieve the five banners. Finally, the two tribe members would assemble the banners into their tribe's flag. The first tribe to have their flag completed would win chocolate, cookies, coffee, powdered milk, tea, sugar, and immunity.The tribes were neck-in-neck until the grappling hook stage of the challenge; while Elyse and Whitney struggled with their grappling hook, Coach and Edna blazed far ahead of them and won the challenge for Upolu. Back at Savaii, Cochran and Papa Bear shared their fear that one of them would be going to Redemption Island after Tribal Council and that the other would go at the next Tribal Council. The rest of the tribe decided on voting out Papa Bear, viewing him as their weakest link, but would tell him that they would be voting for Cochran. Ozzy told Cochran about the plan in an attempt to preemptively quell any paranoia from Cochran. When Jim and Ozzy told Papa Bear that Cochran was going home, Papa Bear saw through their lie and he went to search for the hidden immunity idol in a last ditch effort to save himself. Elyse and Jim followed Papa Bear into the woods to watch him look for the idol.  Failing to find the idol, Papa Bear decided to create a false idol in order to fool the tribe into thinking he had one. Papa Bear then set his plan in motion, telling Jim that he had found the idol. Cochran correctly surmised that Papa Bear's idol was fake, but Cochran was still concerned that everyone else would fall for Papa Bear's scheme and shift the vote from Papa Bear to Cochran.

He apologized to Mikayla for his recent outburst in front of the tribe.

The first castaway to have one bag on all ten crates would win.Before the duel started, Brandon apologized to Christine for his rash behavior toward her during Upolu's first Tribal Council. Acknowledging the apology, Christine edged out Papa Bear to win her second duel in a row. Once Brandon and Edna returned to camp, Edna, now on edge about her status in the tribe due to Brandon's earlier confession to her, decided that she had to emphasize the social aspect of her game by being cordial and polite.  However, she overplayed her \"be nice to everyone\" strategy; due to her constant talking and laughing, Edna just ended up irritating Mikayla and Stacey. At Savaii, Cochran approached Dawn about voting out Elyse next.\n\nReward/Immunity challenge: Three castaways, two men and one woman, from each tribe would stand on perches holding a wooden pole on their shoulders to which weighted bags would be added. Every few minutes, the other four members of the opposing tribe would select someone to bear an additional 20 pounds (9.1 kg) of weight, ergo making it increasingly more difficult for the weight bearers to hold onto their poles; if a weight bearer drops their pole, they would be out of the challenge. The tribe whose weight bearers all drop out of the challenge first loses. The winning tribe is awarded two chicken hens, one rooster, and immunity.At the combined reward/immunity challenge, Savaii chose Dawn, Jim, and Keith to be the weight bearers while Upolu chose Albert, Brandon, and Stacey. Keith dropped out first after 26 minutes and 180 pounds (82 kg). Albert was out next at the same weight. Jim and Brandon surpassed the Survivor record of 220 pounds (100 kg) held by Rupert Boneham in Survivor: Pearl Islands and James \"J.T.\" Thomas Jr. and Brendan Synnott in Survivor: Tocantins by going to 240 pounds (110 kg), but both dropped their poles shortly after the last 20 pounds (9.1 kg) were added. Finally, Stacey dropped her pole at 140 pounds (64 kg), leaving Dawn as the last weight bearer standing, also with 140 pounds (64 kg) as her final weight held total, giving Savaii the win. Stacey expressed her frustration over being the next target for elimination in her tribe due to her previous ties with Christine, even though she believed she had proven herself to be a strong competitor with her performance in the challenge. Stacey appealed to Coach, implying that she deserved to stay over Edna, whom Stacey viewed as annoying and weak. However, Coach confessed that while he \"understood\" Stacey and where she was coming from, she was still not safe. Stacey then tried to stir things up by lying to Brandon, telling him that he needed to watch out for Albert, Mikayla, and Sophie, because the three of them might have formed their own secret alliance. Panicked, Brandon relayed the news to Coach, but Coach cut him off and told him that Stacey knew she was getting voted out next and would say anything to save herself. Annoyed about Brandon's actions, Coach and Sophie mulled over the possibility of kicking Brandon out of the core alliance at some point. At Tribal Council, Brandon broke down emotionally for feeling that he had something to prove by being Russell Hantz's relative and that he had to reclaim the family name in a positive manner. The tribe then discussed their issues of trust and loyalty.

If a ball exits the track and is not caught, the castaway would be eliminated from the challenge.Christine and Stacey lambasted Albert and Mikayla, and told Dawn and Whitney that Coach, whom they declined to call Coach, but instead used his real name, Benjamin, was in complete control, Albert was Coach's right-hand man, and the entire tribe were liars. Christine won her third duel in a row. When Albert and Mikayla returned to camp, they told the tribe about Stacey's venting, which upset Coach as he felt it would put a target on his back. Albert found the clue to the hidden immunity idol, but when he couldn't find the Idol itself, he told Coach and Sophie about the clue to enhance their trust in him. Coach found the hidden immunity idol and told his new sub-alliance of three.\n\nReward/Immunity challenge: Using only their mouths, the castaways would rip pieces of meat off a large pork roast and put it into a basket. The tribe with the most meat in the basket after ten minutes would win vegetables, spices, bread, and the meat that they collected and immunity.The combined reward/immunity challenge was won by Upolu by a slim 2 ounces (56.7 g), continuing the trend of alternating tribal wins. Back at the Savaii camp, Ozzy wanted to vote out Cochran while Jim, Cochran, and Dawn wanted to blindside Elyse to break up her close alliance with Ozzy. In an effort to get the majority fourth vote, Jim approached Keith about voting out Elyse. Keith talked to Whitney about how to vote out Elyse without breaking their alliance with Ozzy. Whitney thought about letting Jim, Cochran, and Dawn vote for Elyse, but she and Keith would vote for anybody but Cochran. At Tribal Council, Keith and Whitney threw their votes against Dawn, allowing the alliance of three to blindside Elyse, sending her to Redemption Island."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US23","season_name":"Survivor: South Pacific","season":23,"episode_number_overall":319,"episode":6,"episode_title":"Free Agent","episode_label":"Ep 6","episode_date":"2011-10-19","episode_length":43,"viewers":11240000,"imdb_rating":7.4,"n_ratings":90,"episode_summary":"When Savaii returned to their camp, Ozzy felt betrayed by the tribe's decision to go behind his back and vote out Elyse, declaring himself a \"free agent\" in terms of no alliances with the tribe. Feeling that he wanted to put everything out in the open, he declared that he had the hidden immunity idol. The rest of the tribe felt that Ozzy was being childish about the blindside. Over at Upolu, Brandon found the clue to the hidden immunity idol and shared it with Coach and Albert. Brandon went on the hunt without knowing that Coach already had the idol. Coach and Albert agreed that telling Brandon that they already had the idol would cause him to fly off the handle.\n\nRedemption Island duel: The castaways would play a variation of shuffleboard. The castaways would start the game with four pucks a piece on the board and would slide another puck to knock their opponent's pucks off the board. The last castaway to have a puck on the board would win.Sophie, Rick, Ozzy, and Keith witnessed Christine continue her domination at the Redemption Island duel with her fourth win in a row. Over at Upolu, Edna continued cozying up with Coach in order to improve her outlier status with the core alliance of five. On day 15, Ozzy realized that his temper tantrum after Tribal Council was a mistake and tried to patch things up with the tribe.\n\nReward/Immunity challenge: Three castaways from each tribe would assemble a wheelbarrow and then push the wheelbarrow around a series of obstacles. Along the way, they would stop at two stations and collect a load of coconuts. At the end of the obstacle course, the three tribe members would dump out the coconuts into a box. The three other castaways would then disassemble the wheelbarrow and reassemble it into a sling shot. They would use the coconuts as ammunition for the slingshot to knock down six targets. The first tribe to knock all six of their targets down would win a trip to the \"sliding rocks\", a waterfall where people can slide down the rocks into a pool below, a picnic lunch, and immunity.At the combined reward/immunity challenge, Savaii struggled during the first half of the challenge, falling way behind Upolu. When Mikayla missed several shots with the slingshot, Coach told her to sit out and let someone else shoot, but she refused and stubbornly kept trying, continuing to miss. Meanwhile, Jim and Keith proved to be adept with their slingshot, allowing Savaii to overcome the deficit and take the win. Coach angrily blamed Upolu's upset loss on Mikayla and privately expressed satisfaction that he wouldn't have to deal with her for much longer, as she was the core alliance's next target. Albert, however, having befriended Mikayla and believing her to be an asset to the tribe, began a campaign to keep Mikayla, arguing that Edna should go instead. Sophie agreed with Albert to vote out Edna. Brandon, however, refused to go along with Albert's plan, arguing that the core alliance had a duty to stay true to their original agreement to vote out Mikayla next. Albert and Sophie then tried to convince Coach that Edna was their weakest link and the tribe still needed Mikayla's strength. However, Coach remained steadfast in his decision to vote out Mikayla, claiming that Edna was much more trustworthy than Mikayla, and he felt that was more important going into the merge. With the alliance split, Rick became the swing vote and Coach and Albert each lobbied hard to win Rick over. At Tribal Council, Brandon once again acted out, this time livid over what he perceived to be a breakdown of loyalty within the core alliance.  In the end, Rick sided with Coach, Edna, and Brandon, sending Mikayla to Redemption Island."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US23","season_name":"Survivor: South Pacific","season":23,"episode_number_overall":320,"episode":7,"episode_title":"Trojan Horse","episode_label":"Ep 7","episode_date":"2011-10-26","episode_length":43,"viewers":11790000,"imdb_rating":8,"n_ratings":95,"episode_summary":"Upon returning to camp after their heated split vote at Tribal Council, the remaining members of Upolu made amends with each other, promising to stay united going forward.

Edna, however, secretly hoped that Brandon's behavior would continue, as it might shift the next target from her to him.\n\nRedemption Island duel: The castaways would dismantle a box and use the pieces as planks to build a bridge. Once they cross the bridge, they would use some of the planks to solve a pattern puzzle. The first castaway to solve their puzzle would win.Sophie, Albert, Ozzy, and Cochran witnessed the duel between Christine and Mikayla. Despite the verbal support that Mikayla received from Albert and Sophie, Christine won her fifth Redemption Island duel in a row in a closely fought match. With Christine's continued domination at the duels and the possibility that Savaii might lose the next challenge, Ozzy began to consider volunteering to be sent to Redemption Island so that he could defeat Christine ahead of a tribal merge. A win by him would mean that the tribes would go into the merge in equal numbers. He approached Cochran about his plan and also offered to give his hidden immunity idol to someone to hold for him while he was at Redemption Island. At Upolu, Coach tried to inspire his tribe by having them all \"find\" the hidden immunity idol. Coach, Albert, and Sophie staged a hunt for the idol for the others. While passing the tree mail stand, Coach and Sophie found a package announcing the upcoming challenge, so they took the opportunity to announce they had \"two pieces of great news\": the upcoming challenge and the \"finding\" of the hidden immunity idol.\n\nReward/Immunity challenge: The tribes would split off in pairs of castaways. One pair would act as callers to the two other pairs as they navigate blindfolded and hooked to a rope through an obstacle course to collect four bags of masks. One pair of castaways would then use only their sense of touch with no help from the rest of the tribe to match the masks into pairs. The first pair to properly match all eight masks would win for their tribe a screening of Jack and Jill and immunity.Both tribes considered the reward/immunity challenge to be crucial, since they had correctly suspected that it was the final tribal challenge of the game and the tribe that won it would secure all of their members going into the merge, and would potentially have a numbers advantage depending on who returned from Redemption Island. Upolu chose Coach and Rick as their callers/rope handlers, while Savaii used Jim and Cochran. The tribes were neck-in-neck through most of the challenge, but on the final heat, Cochran struggled to get Ozzy and Whitney properly hooked into their rope. Savaii fell behind and never recovered, and Upolu ecstatically took the pivotal win. Cochran's entire tribe was extremely upset over his incompetence in the challenge, which concerned Cochran that Ozzy might renege on his plan to volunteer to go to Redemption Island. Sure enough, when Savaii got back to camp, they blamed the loss on Cochran and told him that he could redeem himself at Redemption Island. However, by the next morning, the anger at Cochran had subsided. Ozzy retrieved the hidden immunity idol, presented it to the tribe, and put forth his volunteer plan. Jim and Keith were concerned about Ozzy volunteering to be voted out since if the merge did not happen the next day, the tribe would be weaker with Cochran competing in the next challenge rather than Ozzy. At Tribal Council, Ozzy offered his plan to volunteer with the twist that he would tell Christine that Cochran had found the hidden immunity idol and used it to blindside Ozzy. Before the votes were read, Ozzy handed the idol to Cochran and made Cochran promise to give it back to Ozzy in the event that Ozzy won the right to return to the game.

Both tribes arrived to witness the Redemption Island duel and Upolu was stunned to see Ozzy in the duel. When asked by Jeff if he was surprised to be here,  Ozzy laid it on thick with the resentment towards Cochran on being voted out, but Albert and Coach were suspect about the act. After Jeff announced the rules of the duel, he announced that the winner would return to the game. Ozzy crushed Christine at the duel when he retrieved all his keys and walked through the doorway before Christine was able to retrieve a single key. Jeff told Ozzy that he was back in the game and that the tribes had merged. After the traditional merge feast, Cochran took Coach aside and attempted to infiltrate Upolu's ranks, as per Savaii's plan, but Coach saw right through Cochran's lies and laid out exactly what the former Savaii members were scheming. Assuring Cochran that Upolu wasn't going to fall for Savaii's trap, Coach then gave Cochran a choice: either stay with Savaii and leave the elimination at the next Tribal Council up to chance after an evenly split vote, or truly defect from Savaii and vote with Upolu, guaranteeing Cochran's safety in the dominant alliance. Cochran decided to leave his old tribe and he told Upolu all about Savaii's plans and tribal politics. Cochran kept his word and returned the hidden immunity idol to Ozzy.

Dawn asked Cochran what he was going to do and he told her that he was thinking of flipping tribes. While she had earlier considered joining Cochran, she now wanted to stay loyal to the tribe and warned him to not flip. At Tribal Council, Upolu declared that they saw through Savaii's charade at the Redemption Island duel. Ozzy told them to call their bluff. Before the votes were read, Ozzy played the hidden immunity idol for Whitney. But thanks to Cochran having earlier spilled Savaii's entire plan to Upolu, Whitney received no votes and Savaii's idol was wasted.  Instead, the vote was split along tribal lines with six votes apiece against Keith and Rick. Jeff called for a revote with the castaways only being able to vote for Keith or Rick.

In the second round, Jim beat out Sophie after Sophie gagged on the mouthful of coconut water that would have won the challenge. Back at camp, Jim came up with a plan to stir up Tribal Council by giving the Immunity Necklace to Ozzy and then making a rousing speech to get two of the Upolu tribe to vote against Cochran. When Tribal Council came, Jim and Ozzy made several rousing speeches, but Jim did not hand over the Immunity Necklace because Upolu threatened him before Tribal Council that if he gave his Immunity Necklace to Ozzy, he would be voted out.[32] This sealed Ozzy's fate and he was sent back to Redemption Island, with Dawn and Whitney voting with the Upolu alliance.\n\nImmunity challenge: While balancing barefoot on a beam that narrows in three stages, the castaways would hold a wooden bow with a ball balanced on top.

Albert considered blindsiding Edna which would curry favor from the former Savaii jury members. Albert told Cochran that he would be voted out seventh and his plan to blindside Edna.

To further strengthen the guilt trip that he was trying to lay on the core Upolu alliance, Cochran also told a lie to them that his birthday was near and he wanted to celebrate it in the game. After Cochran left, the Upolu men mulled over the possibility of sparing Cochran from the next vote, getting rid of Edna instead.

After Cochran departed the Redemption Island Arena, Jeff brought out all of the castaways' loved ones. Jeff then tasked Ozzy with choosing three people to spend some time with their loved ones. Ozzy picked Albert and his mother, Coach and his brother, and Brandon and his father. After Edna, Rick, and Sophie left the Arena, Jeff handed the phone back to Ozzy and told the seven that they would be spending their time at Redemption Island. During the visit, Coach took the opportunity to promise Ozzy that \"as a Christian man\" that they would go to the final three should he return to the game. Brandon's father tried to convince Brandon that he needed to play to win, not to always play with honor. Brandon's father then told Coach that Brandon would follow any orders Coach would give as long as he took Brandon to the final three, but Coach was annoyed at the attempted manipulation.\n\nImmunity challenge: The castaways would play on a grid of hexagons.

When the tribe returned to camp, Sophie and Rick expressed their disapproval of Brandon's actions toward Edna during the challenge. Brandon attempted to apologize to Edna, but Edna did not accept it as she thought it was insincere. Edna appealed to Albert, Coach, and Sophie to follow the tribe's mantra of playing with \"Honor. Loyalty. Integrity.\" and to vote Brandon out for going against those values. Edna then took Coach aside, asking him to either pass the Immunity Necklace to her or give her the hidden immunity idol, but Coach refused, saying that he would potentially ruin his own game if he did. Not giving up, Edna went back to Albert and Sophie, proposing that the three of them and Coach make a final four pact.  Believing that Edna would be an easy person to beat in the finals, Albert took her plan into consideration. At Tribal Council, Edna lambasted Brandon for his erratic behavior and his rudeness toward her.

Coach was unsure of whom to go with as all of the other castaways had told him that they wanted to go to the final three with them.\n\nImmunity challenge: With one hand, the castaways would pull on a rope that would steady a balancing board. With the other hand, the castaways would build a tower out of wood blocks to a certain height on one end of the balancing board. The first castaway to build their tower high enough would win.At the immunity challenge, during the middle of the challenge when Sophie was ahead of Ozzy, but had a partial collapse of her tower, she ordered Albert to drop his own efforts in order to help her pick up her dropped blocks. However, Jeff cut off the order by stating that the castaways could not receive any help from other castaways. Sophie never recovered, allowing Ozzy to beat out Coach to win Individual Immunity. When the tribe returned to camp, Coach wanted to vote out Rick as he thought Rick would be a threat for jury votes. Ozzy suggested to Albert to vote out Sophie. Rick also suggested to Coach that they vote for Sophie. At Tribal Council, Coach wore the hidden immunity idol around his neck, leaving the choices of votes to Albert, Rick, and Sophie. The three made their case to stay in the tribe in order to beat out Ozzy. Ozzy told everybody that Coach promised to take him to the final three. Ozzy and Sophie argued what they perceived as personal character attacks against each other. Sophie broke down and cried over the stress of the attacks against her character. After the votes were cast, Coach did not play the hidden immunity idol, and Rick was sent to the jury.\n\nImmunity challenge: The castaways would race through various obstacles to retrieve five bags of puzzle pieces. The first castaway to retrieve all five bags and solve the puzzle would win.On day 38, Coach told Ozzy that he was upset that Ozzy let out his plan to go to the final three together as it was supposed to be a secret between the two of them. Coach thought he was being disrespected by Ozzy. Ozzy told Coach that his actions at Tribal Council were due to being burned earlier in the game by people he trusted and wasn't sure he could trust Coach. At the immunity challenge, Ozzy retrieved all of his puzzle pieces first, but struggled in getting the puzzle started. Once Sophie had the first piece of the puzzle locked in, she quickly caught up and passed Ozzy to win the final immunity challenge. With the loss, Ozzy knew that he was likely to be going home, but he made a pitch to Coach to force a tie at Tribal Council by appealing to Coach's desire to take warriors to the end. At Tribal Council, Coach was torn between staying loyal to his original alliance or allowing Ozzy to take on Albert in a fire starting challenge. In the end, Coach voted against Ozzy and he became the final member of the jury.\nAlbert, Coach, and Sophie enjoyed the traditional day 39 breakfast. At the final Tribal Council, the jury ripped into the final three for actions or questioned their strategies in the game. Albert was criticized for sucking up to the jurors while they were still in the game, giving them false hope of improving their positions in an attempt to win their votes. Sophie was accused of being condescending and pretentious. Coach was blasted for going against his \"honor and integrity\" mantra, manipulating people's religion to his advantage, and hiding behind Christianity, while never owning up to his actions."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US23","season_name":"Survivor: South Pacific","season":23,"episode":16,"episode_title":"Reunion","episode_label":"Reunion","episode_date":"2011-12-18","episode_length":33,"viewers":9920000,"imdb_rating":6.7,"n_ratings":86,"episode_summary":"Months later, it was revealed that the jury had cast the majority vote (six) for Sophie, crowning her as the Sole Survivor.

Jeff divided the tribes into men, Manono, versus women, Salani. Jeff revealed the existence of the Hidden Immunity Idol and that Redemption Island will not be used this season after being used in the last two seasons. Jeff then told the tribes that they had sixty seconds to strip everything of value from the truck. While the women of Salani were busy gathering goods, Michael stole several of their assembled supplies. After the scramble for supplies was done, Jeff tossed the two tribes a map to their camps and the tribes headed off in different directions.\nDuring Salani's trek through the jungle, Alicia formed an alliance with Chelsea, Kat, Kim, and Sabrina. The women arrived first and discovered the two tribes were camping on the same beach. Later the first day, Matt warned Colton that either he could use his \"women\"  connection to advance the Manono tribe or find himself the odd man out and be one of the first to be voted out. Matt also formed an alliance with Bill, Jay, and Michael. After Jay got Manono's fire started, the women tried to negotiate with the men for fire, but their efforts failed. Late that night, Monica and Christina crept into Manono's camp and stole an ember to start a fire, but the fire died out by morning. \nOn Day 2, Christina brokered a deal with the men for fire in exchange for weaving twenty palm fronds for the men. While Alicia agreed to the deal, Christina's bargaining upset her and she vowed to vote out Christina first. Sabrina found a Hidden Immunity Idol intended for the Manono tribe. Before the next Tribal Council, Sabrina gave the idol to Colton, telling him to make a big move in the game.\n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: One at a time, the castaways would jump from a 25-foot (7.6 m) high tower into a net below. Once all of the tribe's castaways complete the jump, the tribe would move on to cross a balance beam and after that a rope bridge. The first tribe to have all of their members across the rope bridge and their tribe flag raised would win immunity and flint.At the combined Reward/Immunity Challenge, Kourtney injured her wrist while landing in the net during the tower jump. When Jeff noticed that Kourtney was kneeling and in obvious pain while waiting her turn on the balance beam, he called a stop to the challenge to tend to Kourtney. The Survivor Medical Team determined that she had a possible broken wrist and pulled her from the challenge to get an X-ray for further diagnosis. Jeff told the tribes that since the challenge requires nine castaways to start and finish, Manono wins by default. However, he gave the men the option to continue the challenge with a nine versus eight competition as a gesture of goodwill. The men declined and took the Tribal Immunity, much to the disappointment of the women. \nThat night, at Tribal Council, a vicious argument broke out between Alicia and Christina over the deal made over the fire and palm frond mats. Jeff told the women that Kourtney suffered multiple fractures of her wrist that would require surgery, she was medically removed from the game, and they would not have to vote anybody out.

Afterward, the men worked on improving their camp but Colton hung out with Salani. The women shooed Colton away to have a women-only meeting. He returned later to tell them he felt alone in the game and that he wanted to spend as much time with the women as he could. The women told him that was not an option for strategic reasons. Later that night, Colton told Jonas, Leif, Tarzan, and Troyzan that he was going to play the Hidden Immunity Idol at the next Tribal Council and that they could blindside Matt or Michael.

Chelsea told Leif that he would be less of a threat in the game if he stepped off. Jeff offered up three hamburgers, potato chips, and a beer. After checking in with Chelsea that her promise was true, Leif stepped off, giving Chelsea the win. Leif gave Chelsea a bite of his bribe. Back at camp, Chelsea and Kim agreed to split the vote between Jay and Troyzan in case one of the played a Hidden Immunity Idol. Kim assured Jay and Troyzan that neither of them were being voted out. Troyzan was still suspicious about Kim and retrieved his Hidden Immunity Idol to play at Tribal Council. Troyzan told Jay that the women were playing them, but Jay still did not believe that the women were going to betray them. Troyzan also told Jay that he was going to play his Hidden Immunity Idol and asked him to vote for Kim. Jay told Kim about Troyzan's plan and told her that they should vote out Alicia. At Tribal Council, the women's alliance stuck to their plan of splitting the vote between Jay and Troyzan.

Items won include food and drinks, letters from home, a shower, and an advantage at the next immunity challenge.Day 26's treemail had envelopes with $500 in cash for a Survivor Auction. Money and items won could not be shared. Alicia spent $500 for a letter from home (from her dad), which she read out loud to the tribe. With the price fixed at $500, Jeff offered the other castaways their letters. Tarzan bought his and decided to keep the letter private. Troyzan was tempted to buy his letter from home, but felt that he had to play the rest of the game on his own. While Christina had enough money to buy her letter, she did not. The others could not afford their letters as they had bought an item earlier in the auction. Egged on by the others, Christina got into a bidding war with Troyzan over the advantage at the next Immunity Challenge. After Troyzan won the item, Sabrina commented that he would still be voted off next. Troyzan told the tribe that he felt that the bidding was another sign that the game had turned into the rest of the tribe versus him. Kat broke the tension by telling Jeff that she still had money left and urging him to continue the auction. The last item for bid, a mystery item, was bought by Kat for $160. The note stated that she had bought the cake for the entire tribe and that they had 60 seconds to eat it. When Troyzan got back to camp, he went off hunting for a new Hidden Immunity Idol without any regard for the others noticing.

He was joined by Tarzan, Kim, and Christina in the second round. Troyzan and Tarzan moved on to the final stage. The final stage was a close match between the men, with Troyzan taking the win. The women were upset at Troyzan for his posturing and trash talk after the win. Back at camp, Chelsea and Kim discussed their plans at Tribal Council now that they could not vote out Troyzan. They decided that they could not vote out one of the women as that would cause too much chaos and either Leif or Tarzan was going to go next. Troyzan told Alicia, Christina, Leif, and Tarzan that they were on the outside of the strong alliance of Chelsea, Kat, Kim, and Sabrina and this was their opportunity to vote out Kim to take control of the game. At Tribal Council, Troyzan continued his confrontation with Chelsea and Sabrina over his new attitude in the game. Troyzan repeated his pitch that the weaker five should join together to vote out the other four. When the voting came, only Leif joined in voting against Kim.

The challenge came down to Alicia and Kim, with Kim taking the win. Jeff then asked Kim to pick one person to join her and she picked Alicia. Jeff then told her that she had one more person to take and she chose Chelsea, which upset Kat, as Kat and Kim had promised to choose each other. Troyzan used Kim's choices to tell Christina, Kat, and Sabrina that it shows exactly where they stood within the women's alliance. While the three were on their reward, they decided that they had to do some damage control when they returned. Meanwhile, back at camp, Troyzan focused on getting Kat to realize that she should feel slighted for not being taken on the reward. Sabrina tried to calm Kat down and get information on how loyal Christina would be to the women's alliance.

Kat was unhappy nobody asked her opinion on what to do and did not want to be seen as a follower or weak player. Sabrina told Christina that, while votes were going to be cast against her, that she was not going to be voted out. Christina told Troyzan about the split vote, which gave Troyzan an opening to get the vote to go against Christina. At Tribal Council, the possible divisions amongst the women's alliance was discussed.

Meanwhile, Jonathan tried to get Michael to flip to the Kalabaw side. Michael and RC discussed flipping, telling Jonathan they could not work with Pete and that they wanted him gone. Michael then talked to Jeff Kent about the possibility of joining Kalabaw to vote out one of the former Tandang tribe members, but Jeff Kent told Michael that he really wanted to vote out Jonathan. Michael agreed to follow Jeff Kent's lead.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would hold on to a metal rod to which one end of a rope is spooled around. The other end of the rope is attached to a bucket overhead, weighted down with 25% of the castaway's body weight. The castaways would try to hold on to the rod and stop it from spinning, which would unspool the rope. The last man and woman to prevent the rope from unspooling and letting the bucket hit the ground would win.At the first Individual Immunity Challenge, Denise and Carter took the first Individual Immunities. At Tribal Council, Abi-Maria laid out her perceived betrayal by RC; alliances and the complexities and ramifications of flipping allegiances were then discussed. After the vote was taken, Jonathan pulled out his Hidden Immunity Idol, successfully foiling Jeff Kent's plan to take him out.  Still, the plan to split the votes came to fruition, and with the five votes against Jonathan negated, RC was blindsided and sent to be the first member of the Jury."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US25","season_name":"Survivor: Philippines","season":25,"episode_number_overall":350,"episode":8,"episode_title":"Dead Man Walking","episode_label":"Ep 8","episode_date":"2012-11-07","episode_length":43,"viewers":10310000,"imdb_rating":8.7,"n_ratings":203,"episode_summary":"Jonathan confronted his old Kalabaw alliance about their betrayal against him.

One at a time, a castaway from each team would swim out into the ocean to attach a line to a fish trap and then dive down to unhook the trap. The other team members would then pull on the line to bring the fish trap and castaway back to the beach. The teams would repeat this until four traps are retrieved. One castaway would then dig into the sand to retrieve a key which would be used to unlock a frame. Two team members would then use puzzle scroll pieces from the fish traps to assemble a banner. The first team to correctly assemble their banner would win a river cruise and a picnic.At the Reward Challenge, the team of Denise, Jeff Kent, Jonathan, Lisa, and Malcolm took the win.  On day 22, Lisa approached Michael and told him that she had discovered Malcolm's Hidden Immunity Idol. She proposed that they stay loyal to the original core Tandang alliance and blindside Malcolm.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would race over and under an obstacle course to untie three bags of puzzle pieces. The first three castaways to cross the finish line with their puzzle bags would move on to the second stage. In the second stage, the castaways would use the pieces to assemble the puzzle.

The team of Carter, Denise, Jonathan, and Malcolm won by a wide margin when Jonathan dug out all four of his team's bags making it easier for the following team members to complete the obstacle course stage.

Denise suggested to her alliance that they vote for Artis to guard against Abi-Maria playing her Hidden Immunity Idol or giving to Pete as she figured that Abi-Maria would be too selfish to give it to Artis. Jonathan continued his appeal to Lisa and also approached Michael about flipping. At Tribal Council, the previous Tribal Council was discussed. Lisa said that she felt that the Kalabaw alliance was more gracious about her big move than her own alliance, but stated that she wanted to stay loyal to her tribe.

Carter opted to exchange his baked potato for the bags of rice and beans to feed the entire tribe. Abi-Maria decided that she would try to stir things up in the tribe by feigning that the advantage she won in the game was much more than it really was.

Denise and Lisa got the question wrong and added the extra weight to begin the challenge. With five moving on to the second stage, it was only Lisa who was left behind. At the second stage, Denise got her question wrong again, making her extra weight 10%, while Carter and Michael added 5%. Jonathan and Carter moved on to face Abi-Maria in the third stage.

He told the tribe that he considered sabotaging the camp as a way to get them to vote him out, but instead decided to tell them upfront to vote him out. However, by the next morning, Brandon had changed his mind and was back to staying in the game for his family.\n\nReward Challenge: Two members from each tribe would hold on to a rope that would suspend a net. The castaways from the other tribe would attempt to toss coconuts into the net which would weigh it down. The castaway who held on to the rope the longest without letting the net touch the ground would win steaks, sausages, vegetables, condiments, and wine for their tribe. Net Bucket challenge from Survivor: Samoa.At the Reward Challenge, Phillip was the last one holding up his net, giving his tribe the win. When Gota returned to camp, everybody went looking for the new Hidden Immunity Idol. Reynold found it and told Eddie that he had it. Over at Bikal, Brandon became upset that Phillip was taking credit for the win at the Reward Challenge and the two argued over what Brandon called Phillip's dictatorial attitude. The two tried to smooth things over and shook hands, but Phillip wanted Brandon voted out as soon as possible. The tension continued to simmer between them until day 13 when things came to a boil. Phillip told Andrea that he was considering throwing the challenge. Andrea passed this along to Brandon. Phillip and Brandon stepped away from camp to again try to settle things between them. Phillip told Brandon that he was not sure he could trust him. Brandon told Phillip that the Stealth R Us nicknames were demeaning and nobody liked him. Phillip said that if that was true, the tribe would vote him out. Brandon then told Phillip \"let me give you a reason to vote me out\" and then proceeded to dump the tribe's rice and beans onto the ground.\nWhen the tribes gathered for the Immunity Challenge, Jeff asked several castaways how they were coping with the conditions. Brandon asked to step off the tribe mat to address Gota. He told them that he was going to give them a second chance and to not let Phillip get to the end of the game. Corinne raised her hand and spoke for the tribe stating that they wanted to forfeit the challenge and give up Tribal Immunity. This sent Brandon over the edge and he went off on his tribe. To ease tensions, Jeff called over Brandon to his side to let him have his say, but the meltdown continued. With things not settling down, Jeff had Erik hand the Tribal Immunity to Julia from Gota and stated that they will have a Tribal Council immediately without torches and fire at the Immunity Challenge site.

The new tribes did not partake in a challenge, but instead returned to their camp sites. At the new Gota, Eddie and Reynold told Erik and Malcolm that Sherri had been gunning for them from day 1 and they would be happy to join the Favorites in voting her out. Meanwhile, Sherri told her side of the story to Andrea and Brenda. Andrea and Malcolm later shared notes about the factions within the former Gota. Over at the new Bikal, Phillip approached Julia about flipping to the Favorites after the tribal merge.

Matt and Michael told Julia that they would join her in voting for Dawn, but were really going to vote for Julia.

The first tribe to tag a member from the other tribe would win a trip to another island where they would be a coffee bar, cookies, croissants, and brownies. Hot Pursuit challenge from Survivor: Palau.However, when the Reward Challenge came, Phillip faltered, dragging his tribe to a decisive defeat. Back at camp, Cochran was concerned about Julia's ties to Phillip and wanted to make sure that one of the Fans was voted out. Phillip thought he had managed to get Julia to flip alliances and to keep that agreement to herself. However, she felt bullied by Phillip and she told Dawn that she felt she had to go along with Phillip's orders. Dawn told Phillip about this and he now wanted to vote Julia out since she had disobeyed his orders to keep it quiet. Over at Gota, Malcolm approached Reynold about setting up an alliance between them, Eddie, and Erik after the merge.

The boat took the Gota tribe to the Bikal beach where the newly merged tribe took part in the traditional merger feast. Malcolm named the tribe Enil Edam; unbeknownst to the tribe, this was to honor his mother Madeline, as Enil Edam is Madeline spelled backwards. Phillip told Andrea that they, along with Cochran and Dawn, could take themselves all the way to the Final Four. Corinne plotted with Malcolm about blindsiding Phillip, and they planned to gather a majority voting bloc comprising Corinne and Michael plus Malcolm's new \"alpha male\" quartet with Erik, Eddie, and Reynold. Their master plan was to vote along with the Favorites in eliminating Sherri before turning on Phillip at the following Tribal Council.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would participate in a local delicacy food eating challenge. The first round would pit two groups of six castaways eating beetle larvae with three castaways moving on from each group.

Malcolm, Eddie, and Cochran then downed the shipworms to advance to the third round. Eddie struggled with the balut giving Malcolm the opportunity to face off against Cochran in the final round. The final round was a close and fast competition, with Cochran barely defeating Malcolm and taking the win, upon which he celebrated giddily. Back at camp, Phillip told Corinne that he wanted to split the vote between Reynold and Eddie, but since she needed both of their votes and wanted to keep them from being nervous, she lobbied to vote out Sherri, aiming to keep the eventual plot to blindside Phillip under the surface. Trying to gather support to blindside Phillip, Corinne talked to Dawn about joining the blindside. Worried about how her reluctance to share important information in her previous appearance resulted in the systematic elimination of her alliance, Dawn decided to relay the information to Cochran, and it travelled through the Stealth R Us' members until it reached Phillip. The core Stealth R Us alliance was concerned that Corinne did have the numbers to blindside Phillip, and went to work to blindside Corinne instead. Phillip told Sherri that she could advance in the game by voting for Corinne. Erik became the swing vote with Andrea telling him to vote for Corinne, while Malcolm told him to vote for Sherri.

Jump Shot challenge from Survivor: Nicaragua.The Reward Challenge was won by the team of Cochran, Eddie, Erik, Michael, and Reynold who defeated Andrea, Brenda, Dawn, Malcolm, and Phillip. Sherri was not picked during the school yard pick and sat out the challenge. While on their reward, Eddie, Michael, and Reynold pitched to Cochran an all guy alliance, but that did not appeal to Cochran as he did not want to join in an alliance with the Fans. While the others were on their reward, Malcolm approached Sherri and Dawn about splitting off from the Stealth R Us alliance and taking control of the game. However, the two women reported Malcolm's try to make a big move to Andrea and Phillip. Seeking to punish Malcolm for his disloyalty, the core alliance told Malcolm that the Stealth R Us alliance would be splitting the vote between Eddie and Reynold when in reality they would be voting for Malcolm. While on a trip to a lagoon, Eddie tried to get Andrea on his side and to vote with him.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The tribe members would be in the ocean under a metal grate as the incoming tide rises. As the tide rises, the breathing space under the grate grows smaller. The last castaway to remain under the grate would win. Last Gasp challenge from Survivor: Palau.At the Immunity Challenge, it came down to Brenda and Andrea. Although Andrea battled the water extremely hard, Brenda's handmade snorkel helped her outlast Andrea to take Individual Immunity. This also marked the first time a woman won this challenge. Back at camp, Malcolm started a plan to target Andrea. Keeping up the fake split vote ploy, Dawn told Malcolm that she would vote with him if Reynold showed her the Hidden Immunity Idol. Reynold did, but then also threatened her that if he felt she would not vote with them that he would play the Idol. This did not go over well with Dawn. Eddie told Andrea that her name was being discussed to be voted out. This caused Andrea to panic and she ran to her core alliance to beg them to change their voting plan. She wanted them to abandon the vote against Malcolm and instead vote for Michael as the safe vote. At Tribal Council, Phillip announced that Sherri was part of the Stealth R Us alliance and also said that anybody who is disloyal to the alliance would get voted out. After the votes were cast, Jeff asked if anybody wanted to play a Hidden Immunity Idol. Reynold stood up to play his Idol, but Malcolm told him to \"hold up bro\", and persuaded Reynold that after Phillip's speech about being disloyal, it was obvious the alliance had voted for Malcolm and that Reynold should give Malcolm the Idol. Reynold tossed the Idol over and Malcolm played it. But when the votes were read, the Idol went for naught as the alliance ceded to Andrea's wishes, voting out Michael who became the first member of the Jury."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US26","season_name":"Survivor: Caramoan","season":26,"episode_number_overall":366,"episode":10,"episode_title":"Zipping Over the Cuckoo’s Nest","episode_label":"Ep 10","episode_date":"2013-04-17","episode_length":43,"viewers":9990000,"imdb_rating":8.9,"n_ratings":177,"episode_summary":"When the tribe returned to camp after Tribal Council, the Stealth R Us alliance went off to have a private conversation and left Eddie, Malcolm, and Reynold back at the camp.

While off at the lagoon on day 26, Dawn accidentally lost her retainer, which contained her bottom teeth. She yelled for Brenda to come help her and threatened to quit if her teeth were not found.

The two formed a sympathetic bond after the incident with Brenda saying that she was solidly behind Dawn.\n\nReward Challenge: The tribe would be divided into two teams of five. One at a time, the teams would race through an obstacle course of balance beams, a water slide, and a mud pit. They would then retrieve a bag of balls in the mud and cross a pit full of rice. Once five bags were retrieved, all of the team members would untie the bags and shoot the balls into a basket. The first team to shoot all twelve of their balls into the basket would win a trip to a resort and lunch. Muddy Waters challenge from Survivor: Philippines.At the Reward Challenge, the team of Cochran, Dawn, Erik, Phillip, and Reynold easily defeated the team of Andrea, Brenda, Eddie, Malcolm, and Sherri. The next day, Dawn continued to unravel as she was sure that Andrea would turn against the Stealth R Us alliance and blindside her at the next Tribal Council. Her paranoia made Cochran and Phillip concerned, but things turned around the next day after Dawn got some sleep. The Stealth R Us alliance agreed to split their vote 4–3 against Reynold and Malcolm just in case one of them had a Hidden Immunity Idol.\n\nImmunity Challenge: Competing in two heats of five, the castaways would race across a platform, dive into the ocean, swim under the platform with the aid of a rope, climb back up onto the platform, retrieve a ring and put it on a post on the other side of the platform.

In the final round, the castaways would have to complete five laps on the course to win. Keel Hauling challenge from Survivor: Pearl Islands.At the Immunity Challenge, Reynold and Andrea won their heat over Cochran, Dawn, and Sherri. Before the second heat was to be run, Phillip said that he was opting out of the challenge due to the underwater stage of the challenge reminding him of a childhood incident. With the second heat down to four, Malcolm won the heat and Eddie should have joined him, but he missed the post with his second ring, allowing Brenda to join the final round. In the final round, it was neck and neck until the end where Reynold defeated Malcolm. With Reynold's win spoiling the Stealth R Us voting plan, they switched to a vote split between Eddie and Malcolm. But their plans were further spoiled when Malcolm found a Hidden Immunity Idol in full view of Andrea, Dawn, and Eddie. The Stealth R Us alliance decided to stick with the split vote plan. At Tribal Council, Eddie thought he was sure to go home, but the Stealth R Us alliance was stunned when Malcolm pulled out his second Hidden Immunity Idol and gave it to Eddie. There was a lot of whispering among the alliance as they tried to figure out how they were going to vote now that all three outsiders had immunity. Malcolm announced that his \"Three Amigos\" of himself, Eddie, and Reynold were going to vote for Phillip, due to the fact he was sucking the life out of the game, labelling Phillip a \"Fun-sponge\". Phillip told his alliance that they should continue their original split voting plan just in case Eddie and Malcolm did not play their Idols. But when the vote came, they did play them. Everybody in the Stealth R Us alliance except Erik kept to the split vote plan, leaving their votes discarded.

Thirty minutes into the challenge, the castaways moved to the top of the a-frame where Dawn, Sherri, and Reynold fell off, leaving Andrea and Brenda to fight it out. They tried to negotiate for one of them to win, but neither wanted to step off. They continued the challenge for three hours when they agreed to share the reward note and to make up their own fourth stage of the challenge by lifting their left foot off the top of the a-frame. Jeff counted down to this new fourth stage and Brenda fell off the top shortly thereafter to give Andrea the win. Back at camp, the reward note turned out to be a clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol. Andrea shared the clue with her whole alliance and they went looking for the idol. Erik found it and handed it over to Andrea. Brenda's determination to stick it out in the challenge made Andrea suspicious of Brenda as she could be a big threat in future challenges.

Just in case Andrea got paranoid at Tribal Council and played the Hidden Immunity Idol, Cochran got his alliance to split the vote between Andrea and Eddie. Andrea told Erik that she would like to go to the final three with him. Erik was not sure if he should join Brenda and Cochran in blindsiding Andrea or joining Andrea in voting out Brenda. At Tribal Council, the timing of a \"big move\" was discussed. When the vote came, Erik made his \"big move\" and decided to vote against Andrea.

Brenda called the decision a \"no brainer\" and gave up the reward. While the four were enjoying their visit, Dawn was livid that she missed out on her loved ones' visit back at camp because of Brenda.

The first castaway to assemble their puzzle would win.Cochran's advantage turned out to be that his puzzle piece bags would not be tied to a post. While the advantage gave Cochran a huge lead into the puzzle assembly stage, he squandered it as the other three caught up to him, but he was able to recover and beat out Dawn for the final Individual Immunity. Back at camp, Cochran's decision came down to either bringing Dawn or Eddie to the final three. Sherri was not deemed any threat at all to win, and was thus completely safe. He chose to take Dawn, fearing Eddie's popularity with many of the male members of the jury, and Eddie became the final member of the jury.\nCochran, Dawn, and Sherri enjoyed the traditional day 39 breakfast. At the Final Tribal Council, the three made their opening statements to the jury. The jury made their statements to the three and questioned the three about their game play. Malcolm told Dawn that she should own up to her game play and asked Cochran what quality he had that allowed him to advance in the game that Malcolm did not have. Eddie asked Sherri if she felt she got carried to the final three to which she replied forcefully she did not only to invoke laughter from several jury members, Dawn about how she could declare herself a strong player when she was seen as weak at camp, and Cochran about how the game had changed him going forward in life and asked if he would ever go on a bro date with the Three Amigos. Phillip \"revoked\" Sherri's membership in Stealth R Us, told Dawn that he would not vote for her, and Cochran that he played a good game. Erik asked Dawn about the damage she caused in her game play. He got into a major argument with Sherri about her game play until Sherri told him to sit down since he would not vote for her anyway. Michael asked Dawn and Cochran why Dawn was perceived as being a villain while Cochran was not. Reynold used his time to tell Dawn he thought she was a fraud and asked what she really thought of him. Andrea asked Cochran to choose an animal that he played the game most like and told Dawn she was proud of her game. Brenda asked Cochran why she should vote for him after he had orchestrated her elimination right after the selfless family visit gift she had given him and the others and he replied that getting rid of her was purely a strong game move and hoped she would respect that as a fellow player, and asked Dawn to remove her dental appliance in front of the jury to show that she would have stayed in the game if she had not recovered it."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US26","season_name":"Survivor: Caramoan","season":26,"episode":15,"episode_title":"Reunion","episode_label":"Reunion","episode_date":"2013-05-12","episode_length":33,"viewers":8130000,"imdb_rating":5.7,"n_ratings":113,"episode_summary":"Nearly a year later, the jury vote went unanimously for Cochran and he became the Sole Survivor by a vote of 8–0–0.

The next morning, Jeff Probst welcomed the 20 castaways to the game and announced that they would not be playing the game with their loved ones, but against them. The castaways split into their tribes and Jeff sprung a second twist on them that they would immediately vote out a member of their tribe. Tadhana voted out Laura B., while Galang voted out Candice. Jeff then announced that Redemption Island was back in play, but with a twist that the loved one of the castaway could switch places with them. Rupert immediately stepped forward to take his wife Laura's place and she joined his tribe, Galang. After discussing it between themselves, John did not switch with his wife, Candice. At their new campsite, Brad arranged an all-male alliance at Tadhana.\n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: Six castaways from each tribe would race out into the ocean and over a set of three obstacles to a boat. They would then dive down to untie knots to free the boat. The castaways would paddle the boat back to shore and deliver a chest with three bags of puzzle pieces.  The other three members of the tribe would then assemble the puzzle pieces into a ship's wheel which would be used to raise a flag. The first tribe to raise their flag would win immunity and a reward of flint.Gervase struggled with the swimming part of the challenge, requiring assistance from Aras, which gave Tadhana a huge lead at the end of the boat stage of the challenge. The lead was squandered during the puzzle stage as Laura M., Monica, and Tina worked efficiently to solve the puzzle to give Galang the win. Gervase's excessive celebration at the win did not go over well with Tadhana and that put a target on his niece, Marissa, despite her comments against her uncle's actions. The boys’ alliance knew from day one that they wanted to vote out one of the women and was trying to decide between Katie, who was seen as ineffective at the puzzle stage of the challenge, and Marissa, who was guilty by association for Gervase's excessive celebration.

Over at Tadhana, Rachel tried to secure her position among the men's alliance while Ciera tried to swing the vote to Rachel by suggesting to others that she had an alliance with John.\n\nRedemption Island Challenge: The castaways would use a long pole to maneuver a wooden spool through a metal rod structure. They would then balance the spool on the top of the structure. The structure is mounted on a spring, so the structure would sway if the castaway touches the structure while maneuvering the spool, possibly toppling the spools from the top of the structure. The first two castaways to stack ten spools on top would remain in the game.Jeff announced that the first finisher would be able to give a clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol to any castaway of their choice. Candice and Rupert were close to finishing the duel when Rupert's stack toppled over. Candice cruised to finishing first, while Rupert was unable to recover, allowing Marissa to continue on. Candice gave the clue to Hidden Immunity Idol to John. Back at camp, Vytas suggested to his alliance that they vote out Rachel in order to tempt Tyson into taking her place and weakening Galang in the process. John didn't want to vote out Rachel as if Tyson did switch at the duel, it would mean more competition to Candice.\n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: Three castaways would roll a fourth castaways in a barrel to four platforms to retrieve four bags of balls.

Tyson then called out Brad for voting out Rachel, who fired back at the whole Galang tribe and stated that it was hard to vote out their fellow tribe members. But Brad was immediately rebuffed by Marissa, who said that Tadhana had voted out the two strongest women when they had the opportunity to vote out the weaker members of their tribe, making more sense and causing less tension. Brad told her that this was part of the game, but Marissa responded by cursing at him. Suddenly, Colton began to break down crying and told everybody that he wanted to quit. Jeff lambasted Colton for quitting, and even claimed that Colton faked appendicitis during Survivor: One World, making him a two-time quitter. Colton denied this and then departed the game, taking his buff with him.\n\nRedemption Island Challenge: The three castaways would stack wooden blocks like a line of domino tiles while avoiding bars that would topple the tiles that were already stacked. Once all of the blocks were properly stacked, the castaway would start a chain reaction which would release a ball that would smash a plate.  The first two castaways to break their plates would remain in the game.Candice took first place for the second time, while Marissa barely edged out Rachel after over 45 minutes of work. Candice gave John the second clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol.\n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: Facing off one-on-one, the castaways would battle sumo style using padded bags to try to knock their opponent off a platform and into the ocean to score a point for their tribe.

The Survivor Medical Team cleared him to remain in the game but advised he sit out the remainder of the challenge. Laura M. defeated Ciera in the final round to give Galang their third straight win. Back at camp, John lobbied to vote out Ciera as she didn't do as much work around camp as Katie. After John walked away, Brad proposed that they vote out John as Brad was worried that if Candice continued to win at Redemption Island, Brad would lose his control over John when Candice returned to the game. Brad organized the others to vote for John, but said that he didn't want to vote for John himself.

At the end of the rope, the castaway would untie a key from the buoy and use the key to unlock a bag of puzzle pieces. The first two castaways to solve their puzzle would remain in the game.John came in first followed by Candice after Marissa faltered at the puzzle. At Candice's suggestion, John gave Monica the clue to the location of the Hidden Immunity Idol. However, at Brad's urging, Monica burned the clue in the ceremonial buff burning urn without looking at it. Back at the Tadhana camp, Brad started to feel the heat from his tribe members about continually voting out their loved ones, so he decided that Caleb should be the next to go since Colton had already quit the game. Caleb, Hayden, and Vytas agreed to vote off one of the girls, but were wary of being \"Johnned\" by Brad. They wanted to keep Brad into the merge as that would take the heat off them. Over at Galang, Gervase and Tyson formed an alliance since their loved ones were now out of the game.\n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: The castaways would paddle out into the ocean to retrieve five crates tied to the bottom of the ocean. Once all five crates were returned to the beach, the castaways would use the crates to build a staircase. Two castaways would then solve a puzzle revealing the combination on a wheel that would lead them to a key. The key would unlock a handle to raise a flag.

When the vote came, Ciera decided to break from her alliance, forcing a 3–3 tie between Hayden and Monica. Jeff called for a revote and the vote was tied again. Jeff told Ciera, Gervase, Katie, and Tyson that they must unanimously agree to vote out Hayden or Monica or they would draw rocks. Ciera explained to her alliance that she voted for Monica because she felt she was fourth in the alliance and, unless Tyson and Gervase would join her vote, she would draw rocks. When nobody budged from their position, Ciera, Katie, and Tyson drew rocks to break the stalemate. Katie drew the white rock and she was sent to Redemption Island."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US27","season_name":"Survivor: Blood vs. Water","season":27,"episode_number_overall":383,"episode":13,"episode_title":"Out On a Limb","episode_label":"Ep 13","episode_date":"2013-12-11","episode_length":44,"viewers":9920000,"imdb_rating":7.5,"n_ratings":97,"episode_summary":"Upon returning from Tribal Council, Tyson, tired of Monica over-strategizing, revealed to Monica and Gervase that he again had found the Hidden Immunity Idol and, thus, they did not have to worry about the next vote.\n\nRedemption Island Challenge: The three Redemption Island inhabitants would use rope to tie together sticks in order to make a pole to retrieve three keys.

Laura M. gave the clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol to Ciera, which she shared with Hayden. The two went looking for it, but when they could not find it, Hayden reasoned that Tyson already had it. Ciera and Hayden agreed that the best plan of action would be to try to break Monica from her alliance with Gervase and Tyson by telling her that the two guys were just leading her on and that Tyson had her on a leash.\n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: Starting from a platform out in the ocean, the castaways would guide a buoy along a rope and around an obstacle. Once on shore, the castaways would untie a bag of puzzle pieces.

The last castaway to keep their vase balanced on the seesaw would return to the game.Hayden dropped his vase after 15 minutes to become the fifth member of the jury. Tina then outlasted Laura M. to rejoin the game and to send Laura M. to the jury. Tina kept the clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol. She and Ciera went looking for the idol in vain, so they turned to working on Monica to turn on her alliance.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would pull on a rope attached to an unbalanced table to keep the table level. They would stand a wooden block on end and have to hold on to the rope to keep the block upright. They would then retrieve one of nine wooden blocks from three stations while keeping all the blocks on the table upright. Once the block was retrieved, the castaway would have to stack the block on the table and retrieve the other blocks. Should any of the blocks fall, the castaway would have to return to the table and restack the blocks. The first castaway to have all ten blocks standing for a three count would win immunity.Tyson defeated Gervase and Monica. Back at camp, Tyson wanted Gervase and Monica to decide between themselves to vote out Ciera or Tina. The argument between them became rather heated. At Tribal Council, Ciera and Tina resumed their pitch to Monica to join them. When the vote was about to be read, Tyson gave his Hidden Immunity Idol to Gervase and he played it. The votes against Gervase was negated, but he did not need the added protection of the Idol as Monica had voted for Ciera and she was sent to the jury. Monica was furious that Tyson gave the Hidden Immunity Idol to Gervase without telling her.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would race through an obstacle course and a water slide to retrieve six bags of puzzle pieces, two at a time.

The three made their opening statements to the jury and then Jeff opened the floor to the jury to make their own statements and ask questions. Vytas told Tyson that he was not going to get his vote, that Gervase playing \"old school\", as noted in his opening statement, meant that he was not adapting to the game; and that he was unsure of whom he was going to vote for. After Tyson said in his opening statement that he played the game without malice, Katie asked him about the malice in his comment that she was headed to the jury after they drew rocks. Tyson said that that was his one regret in the game and apologized for it. Caleb asked Gervase about his big move in the game and Monica about revealing something about herself. Ciera asked Tyson if he viewed himself as a villain or hero, while she asked Gervase if he ever considered voting out Tyson. Laura M. asked Monica about who she was and about being vulnerable. Tina asked the three to pick one word to describe themselves, with Monica picking \"generous\", Gervase picking \"honorable\", and Tyson picking \"fun-loving\". Hayden asked Tyson if he had the Hidden Immunity Idol when he drew rocks and Monica about what the jury's perception of her was as he felt that nobody really knew her.

David, Sarah, and LJ were chosen for the Brains, Brawn, and Beauty tribes respectively; they then had to pick their tribe's weakest player as David, Sarah, and LJ respectively chose Garrett, Trish, and Morgan. All three were flown by helicopter to their camps, while the remaining tribe members had to walk there. Upon arriving at camp, the weakest players had to choose between an extra bag of rice for the tribe or a clue to a hidden immunity idol. Garrett and Morgan chose to look for the Idol, but only Garrett found one, while Trish chose the extra bag of rice. Brice began to bond with Morgan after noticing bonds were forming between LJ and Jeremiah, and Alexis and Jefra. At the Brawn camp, Woo recognized Cliff as a basketball star, but the tribe didn't care about Cliff's past. Sarah confronted Tony, as she pegged him as being a cop, but he denied it and claimed to be a construction worker. At the Brains camp, J'Tia was leading the tribe in building their shelter despite coming across as bossy.\n\nReward/Immunity challenge: The tribes would start at one end of a course with a wagon. Along the way, they would retrieve keys from a tall post with a long pole to unlock three trunks with puzzle pieces inside, and put the trunks on the wagon. After getting all three trunks, the tribes would have to disassemble the wagon and push the pieces of the wagon and the trunks either through or over a fence, then climb over the fence themselves. They then would re-assemble the wagon, put the trunks on board, and drag the wagon through more obstacles. Once at the finish, two tribe members would take the pieces out of the trunks and assemble the vertical puzzle. The first two tribes to finish would get immunity; the first-place tribe would also get a fire-making kit, while second place would get flint to make fire.At the challenge, the Brawns and the Beauty tribe took a big lead; by the time the Brains tribe began the puzzle, the other tribes were almost finished. The Beauty tribe finished first with the Brawn tribe coming in second. At the Brains camp, Kass and David debated over whom to vote out: Kass wanted J'Tia out for her poor attitude and work ethic, while David wanted to target Garrett, who he saw as a threat later in the game. Garrett was conflicted between voting for J'Tia and David after being selected by David as the weakest tribe member. J'Tia and Tasha agreed to Garrett's plan, but Spencer was paranoid about David potentially having an idol and believed J'Tia was the easier vote. In the end, Spencer sided with Garrett and David was voted out.\nAfter the vote, Kass found herself in a swing vote position, sitting between Spencer and Garrett, and J'Tia and Tasha, eventually allying with the former. At the Brawn camp, Cliff and Woo bonded, while Tony wasn't fond of Cliff's popularity within the tribe. Trish and Lindsey argued over workload. Tony built a hiding spot in the shelter, named the \"Spy Shack,\" to eavesdrop on his tribe's conversations. At the Beauty camp, Jeremiah and Morgan bonded, while Brice attempted to solidify an alliance with them.\n\nReward/Immunity challenge: The tribes would race out into the ocean and climb over and into a bamboo cage. The tribe would then have to untie an underwater door on the cage bottom and drag heavy fish traps through the door and back to the beach. Once on the beach, they must retrieve puzzle pieces inside the fish traps. After that, one member from each tribe must assemble a rotating fish themed gear puzzle. The first two tribes to finish would get immunity; the first-place tribe would receive a deluxe fishing kit, including nets, lures, worms, along with a pan and spices, while second place would receive fish lures, weights, and line.At the challenge, the Brawn and Brains tribes took an early lead over the Beauty tribe. The Brawn tribe placed first while J'Tia of the Brains tribe struggled with the puzzle. The Beauty tribe managed to come from behind and place second, thanks to LJ's work on the puzzle, sending the Brains to their second consecutive Tribal Council. After the challenge, Tony found a clue to the hidden immunity idol in the reward and ended up finding the idol. At the Brains camp, Garrett, not wanting anyone to have private talks with each other, began an open discussion with the tribe on whom to send home as he, Kass, and Spencer had agreed on voting out J'Tia. Tasha argued with Garrett, as she wanted to strategize and believed Garrett was not playing the game correctly. When Tasha attempted to privately talk with Kass about voting out Garrett, Garrett and Spencer followed them. With her tribe distracted, J'Tia dumped most of their rice into the fire due to being angry about her tribe wanting to vote her out. At Tribal Council, Garrett got into an argument with J'Tia and Tasha, and outed his alliance with Spencer and Kass. In the end, Kass flipped, siding with the other women to vote out Garrett, who had left his hidden idol back at camp."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US28","season_name":"Survivor: Cagayan","season":28,"episode_number_overall":386,"episode":2,"episode_title":"Cops-R-Us","episode_label":"Ep 2","episode_date":"2014-03-05","episode_length":44,"viewers":9580000,"imdb_rating":7.7,"n_ratings":153,"episode_summary":"Spencer questioned the rest of his tribe if J'Tia would have been voted out if Garrett had not had an open discussion about the vote.

The two formed an alliance, naming it \"Cops-R-Us.\" Tony lied to Sarah, claiming that Cliff and Lindsey suggested an interest in getting Sarah out of the game. A rain storm came down on the castaways throughout the night and following day. At the Beauty camp, LJ ventured off during the storm in search of the hidden immunity idol and eventually found it. At the Brains camp, they all practiced throwing water to each other from coconut-to-coconut based on their challenge clue.\n\nReward/Immunity challenge: One tribe member closest to the ocean would collect a bucket of water. They then had to work with their tribe to pass the water to each other by throwing it in the air and catching it in their buckets, with the final member eventually dumping the remaining water into a container which, when filled, would drop and release a ball. Two tribe members would then use the ball to complete a circular maze with the winning tribe receiving a tarp and other comfort items along with immunity while the second place tribe would receive immunity and a tarp.The Brawn tribe finished first with the Brains tribe coming in second. At the Brawn tribe, Tony found a clue in their reward to the hidden immunity idol and hid it, as he already had found the idol. The Beauty tribe began looking to Tribal Council as LJ asked the tribe if anybody wanted to go home, but received no responses. The alliance of LJ, Jeremiah, Jefra, and Alexis decided to split the vote between Brice and Morgan in case of a hidden immunity idol, while the two outsiders attempted to sway Jeremiah into voting with them for Alexis.

Morgan worked on convincing Jefra and Alexis that Jeremiah had actually been the one organizing the vote for Alexis. Back at the Brains' camp, they again practiced for a challenge based on the clue they received in tree-mail.\n\nReward challenge: One member of each tribe would act as a caller while two other blindfolded tribe members would navigate the course to retrieve five items and a flag, eventually working with a third blindfolded tribemate to hoist the items up to the caller's platform. The winning tribe would receive three egg-laying hens and a rooster, while the second-place tribe would receive a dozen eggs.Throughout the challenge, the Beauty and Brains tribes were neck-and-neck while Brawn constantly trailed. However, after the Beauty tribe won the challenge, J'Tia of the Brains struggled with hoisting the last item, a flag, resulting in the Brawn tribe catching up and eventually placing second. At the Beauty camp, Jeremiah pulled out a note from their reward in front of the tribe, a hidden immunity idol clue which he read out loud. He proceeded to kill the rooster for the tribe to eat by ripping its head off. At the Brawn's camp, Sarah conspired to get Cliff out of the game due to Tony's lie to Sarah about Cliff targeting her, convincing Woo and Trish to throw the upcoming immunity challenge to do so.\n\nImmunity challenge: All tribe members would take turns diving into the water to retrieve buoys. Once all five are collected, tribe members must throw them into a basket floating in the water. Two tribe members would stay in the water to retrieve any buoys that miss the basket; the person throwing could not throw until they had all un-scored buoys on their platform.The Beauty tribe came in first place. Despite the attempts of several Brawn tribemates to throw the challenge, they finished again in second place, sending the Brains tribe back to Tribal Council. Kass and Tasha weighed their options and considered whether they would vote for Spencer, who was outside their women's alliance but their best challenge competitor, or J'Tia, who was in their alliance but also a challenge liability who had dumped their rice in a prior fit of rage.

The entire \"Brawn\" tribe, with the exception of Sarah, joined two \"Beauty\" members, LJ and Jefra, to make up the new Solana tribe. Sarah would be joined by the three remaining \"Brains\" (Kass, Spencer, Tasha) and the remaining \"Beauty\" members (Jeremiah, Alexis, Morgan) to make up the new Aparri tribe.\n\nReward challenge: One member of each tribe would hang on to a post. Two members of the opposing tribe would attempt to remove them from the post and drag them across the sand to the finish line. The first tribe to get the member of the other tribe across the finish line would receive one point. The first tribe to score two points wins coffee and pastries.The new Solana tribe won the challenge 2–1 after Cliff proved too heavy for Spencer and Jeremiah to shift. Back at the Solana camp, LJ and Trish formed a bond after both found out they were from Massachusetts. This led to the chagrin of her fellow \"Brawn\" allies, who were concerned that Trish would abandon their alliance.

Soon after, Jeff stopped by Solana's camp to inform the tribe of Lindsey's decision to leave.\n\nReward challenge: Facing off one against one in a fenced off circle, a castaway from each tribe would hold a wooden idol on top of a platform that they would hold in one hand. They would use the other free hand to attempt to knock their opponent's idol off the platform. The castaway whose idol hit the ground last would score one point for their tribe. First tribe to four points would get to raid the other tribe's camp.The Solana tribe won the reward challenge and selected Tony and Woo to go to the Aparri camp and pick two items they'd like to take. Tony and Woo opened two notes given to them at the challenge: one informing them of the items they could choose from and the second being a clue to the hidden immunity idol at their own camp. Instead, Tony pretended they were given a clue to assign to a member of the Aparri tribe, giving it to Jeremiah in an attempt to make him a target. Jeremiah later realized that the clue was the same one he had received while on the original Solana tribe and therefore useless to him at Aparri, though Spencer and Alexis appeared skeptical about that claim.\n\nImmunity challenge: Each tribe would build a staircase out of wooden poles, then climb it to reach a bamboo maze. Upon exiting the maze and sliding down a bamboo slide, one tribe member would maneuver a key through a rope obstacle, using the key to unlock a machete to release puzzle pieces. Two more tribe members would then solve a puzzle to reveal the solution to a combination lock.

At the Aparri camp, Alexis attempted to convince the rest of the tribe to vote out Jeremiah, believing him to be the most likely person to turn against them after the merge. Spencer saw through Alexis's scheming and felt she came across as fake, along with the worry that Alexis would rejoin former Beauty allies LJ and Jefra at the merge.

Despite some tension between Kass and Sarah, the former Aparri tribe had a one-member numerical advantage, so Tony attempted to get his former Brawn ally Sarah to flip to the Solana alliance.\n\nImmunity challenge: The castaways would stand barefoot on wooden slats on an a-frame that was floating in the water and try to remain balanced.

LJ repaid the favor by playing his own idol on Tony, ensuring that both men were safe from the vote. \"The other one\" turned out to be Jefra, wasting both idols.

After another 10 minutes, those still in the challenge would move to the narrowest section with their hands at the bottom section of the pole. The last castaway with their ball still balanced on the pole would win immunity.In the third stage of the challenge, Tasha outlasted Spencer and Woo to win her second consecutive individual immunity. After the immunity challenge, a paranoid Tony ransacked the forest to find another hidden immunity idol, which he eventually found under a large tree. Upon uncovering it, he discovered that it was the idol with \"different powers,\" with the ability to be played after the votes are read. Trish and her alliance attempted to console Jefra and stop her from flipping. Their attempt was successful, and Jefra confessed to Jeremiah that she was not going to be voting with them. Spencer told Tasha and Jeremiah that he had a hidden idol, and they decided to vote against Woo.

Kass, for the minimum price of $20, bought a steak sandwich. Woo, for $40, bought a plate of ribs in barbecue sauce. Jefra bought a Quesadilla with guacamole and a margarita. Spencer and Tony both spent $500 on a potential advantage in the game, and drew between a white rock and a black rock, with the black rock determining who would get the advantage. Tony drew the black rock. Tasha ultimately spent no money.Tony's advantage, rather than an advantage in the immunity challenge as expected, instead turned out to be a clue for another regular hidden immunity idol, which he later found and showed to his alliance. Meanwhile, Tasha spent time with the three other remaining women on the tribe, as Spencer put into Tony's head the idea that the women may form an all-woman alliance and pick the guys off, also mentioning that Jefra tried to blindside Tony in the last vote.\n\nImmunity challenge: The castaways had to dig in a circle of sand until they found a rope, which ran underground and was tied to five bags. Once the castaways pulled all five bags up and out of the ground, they had to untie the bags, each releasing one ball.

The first castaway to land all five balls won immunity.Tasha narrowly defeated Woo to win her third consecutive immunity challenge. Afterwards, the majority alliance solidified a plan to vote Spencer out. However, Tony explored a different option and discussed voting Jefra out with Woo and then Spencer, feeling it would be the better option as to avoid an all-woman alliance. Spencer explained the plan to Tasha, who agreed to vote with them. Tony became nervous when Spencer continued looking for a hidden immunity idol.

In the heat of their argument, Tony dared Kass to vote for him at the next Tribal Council, admitting that he had a special hidden immunity idol, and threatened that Kass would go home if she wrote his name down.\n\nReward challenge: The castaways were split into two teams of three, and would take turns throwing sandbags at a wall of wooden blocks that formed a puzzle, and when one puzzle was completely knocked down, the two teams would switch and begin rebuilding their respective puzzles. The first team to finish their puzzle would serve as Survivor ambassadors and deliver school supplies to a local school, followed by a meal of burgers and hot dogs.The team of Spencer, Kass, and Woo initially fell behind, but Spencer managed to pull ahead with Kass's help and win the reward.

The castaway with the heaviest bucket would win pizza and soft drinks delivered to them at camp.Tony won the challenge, with his bucket fully overflowing with mud and chose Trish to share the reward with him. While the two of them ate, Spencer, Kass, and Woo once again began planning to vote out either Tony and Trish, saying that the pair was inseparable. Woo seemed more willing to go along with this plan due to his new distrust of Tony.

The next morning, the final four castaways were given a feast and visited by their loved ones: Kass' husband, Woo's cousin Mikey, Spencer's sister Taryn, and Tony's best friend Arnold. Arnold explained that Tony's wife, his original loved one choice, decided to stay home with their four-month-old daughter, which led to Tony crying over missing his family.\n\nImmunity challenge: The castaways would stand on a pole in the water, lowering a bucket to get water to fill a bamboo chute, which would raise a key. Upon retrieving the key, the castaway would swim back to shore and unlock puzzle pieces. The first castaway to solve the puzzle would win immunity.Despite being the last person to release their key, Kass made a huge comeback on the puzzle portion to win immunity.

After winning rock-paper-scissors, Hunahpu earned the right to choose their rep, and Jeremy volunteered. Host Jeff Probst revealed that Jeremy would be competing against his loved one, his wife Val.\n\nReward challenge: The duelists, tethered to ropes tied through a wooden cube, would untangle the ropes attached to them to release two rings. They would then use the rings and ropes to lasso two wooden platforms. First castaway to retrieve both their platforms would win flint and a bag of beans for their tribe.Jeremy won the duel and, as a result, Val was sent to Exile Island. Jeremy also had to choose someone from his tribe to join Val; he chose Keith. Upon arriving at the Hunahpu camp, Jeremy quickly made alliances with Missy, Kelley, and Natalie. At Coyopa, Dale, the oldest member of his tribe, struggled to fit in and, during a trip to the well, found and pocketed a mysterious wooden fragment, unsure of whether or not it was a hidden idol. Dale later won favor with his tribe after successfully making fire with his glasses. On Exile Island, Val and Keith chose urns to see who would get a clue to a hidden immunity idol; Val picked the urn containing the clue, and lied to Keith about what the note actually was. Back at Coyopa, Wes correctly identified his tribemate John as John Rocker, former relief pitcher for the Atlanta Braves baseball team. While Wes hoped that this would forge an alliance between the two, John became wary of Wes's newfound knowledge, and considered voting him out. At the immunity challenge, Keith and Val rejoined their tribes from Exile Island.\n\nImmunity challenge: All nine tribemates would crawl under an obstacle, then retrieve three bags of pieces hung high above. The tribe would then use the pieces to ascend several stories of a massive tower, first by throwing a rope onto a hook then climbing the rope, the second by assembling and climbing up pegs, and the third only using their bodies. At the top of the tower, four tribemates would solve a puzzle using the remaining pieces. The first tribe to successfully complete the puzzle would win immunity.Coyopa used John's height and strength to take an early lead, however they struggled at the puzzle and lost the challenge. At Hunahpu, Jeremy apologized for sending Keith to Exile Island, and promised to make it up to him. At Coyopa, Dale became wary of Nadiya for her backstabbing gameplay on The Amazing Race. The tribe was divided by gender lines, with Josh, perceived by Nadiya as \"one of the girls\" for being gay, caught in the middle. He was approached by Baylor, who decided to stick with him and not necessarily the other women. The women decided to target Dale due to his age, and the men targeted Nadiya.

Then, they will roll three balls to land in a series of holes. The first duelist to land all three balls in the holes would receive fishing gear for their tribe.Julie won in a blowout victory, and chose Jeremy to join John on Exile Island. Before the tribes left, Hunahpu attempted to bargain with Jeff for a new flint, offering their remaining supply of beans for trade. Jeff vocalized that the trade was poorly planned and unbalanced, in turn putting Hunahpu's newly-won fishing gear on the line, which the tribe reluctantly accepted as trade. At Coyopa, with John exiled, the tribe discussed his past as a baseball player, and Dale brought up the controversial statements he made about minority groups.

At Tribal Council, Val and Jaclyn attempted to rally support against Baylor, publicly accusing her of playing both sides, while Val was called out for claiming to have two idols in hopes she would play one.

The new Hunahpu tribe lamented their nearly-depleted supply of rice, while Natalie and Jeremy were afraid that they would be in the minority against the three former Coyopa members—Alec, Josh, and Wes—and Reed, Josh's boyfriend, so they attempted to sway Alec to form an alliance of those whose loved ones had already been voted out.

Jon found it in Julie's bag, and the tribe ate it out of anger for her selfishness; when Julie returned from a walk, the tribe gave her the cold shoulder.\n\nImmunity challenge: The castaways would balance a ball on a disc attached to knotted ropes, moving their hands up a knot every few minutes to increase difficulty. After 25 minutes, a second ball would be added. Castaways would be eliminated when a ball fell off their disc; the last castaway with all balls remaining would win immunity.Keith outlasted Wes to win the first individual immunity of the game. Upon returning to camp, Julie overheard Alec making fun of her for taking the trail mix, and later told Missy that she was considering quitting due to missing her eliminated boyfriend John and feeling alone; while Missy implored Julie to stay in the game for at least one more night, Julie perceived that Missy's support was only because she needed Julie to vote with their alliance that night, and felt further alienated. After weighing offers from both sides, Jon and Jaclyn decided to join Josh’s couple-heavy alliance and blindside Jeremy, however, Julie decided to officially quit the game after a quick talk with Jeff outside camp. Jeff informed the rest of the castaways of Julie's decision and cancelled that night's Tribal Council, leaving Josh and Jeremy's feud intact for at least three more days."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US29","season_name":"Survivor: San Juan del Sur","season":29,"episode_number_overall":405,"episode":8,"episode_title":"Wrinkle In the Plan","episode_label":"Ep 8","episode_date":"2014-11-12","episode_length":43,"viewers":9510000,"imdb_rating":7.4,"n_ratings":102,"episode_summary":"The remaining competitors were upset at Julie for quitting and postponing a Tribal Council, but Jon and Jaclyn reaffirmed their commitment to vote out Jeremy.

One teammate would run to the top of the temple to unlock a statue, and the whole team would then hoist the statue to the top of a structure to unlock a flag. The first team to unlock their flag would win a trip to a taco bar and a feast including chicken, pork, steak, beer, and margaritas.The team of Reed, Keith, Wes, Jeremy, and Natalie maintained their lead to win the challenge; they chose to exile Jon. At the taco bar, the winners enjoyed their reward, but the combination of players from the two different factions resulted in awkward exchanges, although Wes' overeating and subsequent sickness alleviated some tension. Back at camp, Josh again pleaded with Baylor for her vote but, even after reminders of his protection of her on the old Coyopa tribe, she refused to vote with Josh's alliance. On Exile Island, Jon found a new hidden immunity idol after receiving a clue. After the reward winners returned to camp, the rest of the tribe was turned off by Wes, Alec, and Keith's candid discussion of their bodily functions, and misogynistic behavior toward the women, which alienated Jaclyn and pushed her toward the women and Jeremy's alliance.

Upon arriving to camp, Jon told Jaclyn about his idol, while Josh's alliance shifted their target to Baylor. Jaclyn persuaded Jon to betray Josh's alliance for their poor treatment of her in Jon's absence and for the men's potential as challenge threats.

At Tribal Council, Jaclyn and Jon evaluated their swing vote status, and members of both sides publicly pleaded for their votes; Jaclyn announced her disappointment in Josh's alliance for disrespecting her when Jon wasn't around, and that led to them ultimately siding with Jeremy's alliance to send Josh to the jury."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US29","season_name":"Survivor: San Juan del Sur","season":29,"episode_number_overall":406,"episode":9,"episode_title":"Gettin' to Crunch Time","episode_label":"Ep 9","episode_date":"2014-11-19","episode_length":44,"viewers":9850000,"imdb_rating":7.8,"n_ratings":107,"episode_summary":"After his boyfriend Josh's elimination, a livid Reed vowed to rebound while the rest of his tribemates dealt with the repercussions of Jon and Jaclyn officially joining Jeremy's alliance. \n\nReward challenge: The tribe was divided into two teams of five; one member per team would face off on a wobbly beam and try to knock the opponent into the mud pit below. The winning competitor would earn a point for their team; first team to five points would win a yacht ride down the San Juan del Sur coast and enjoy a feast of sandwiches, cocktails and champagne.After a 4-4 tie, Baylor defeated her mother Missy to win the challenge for her, Alec, Reed, Jeremy, and Natalie. Natalie and Jeremy decided to give up their spots on the reward to Jon and Jaclyn out of gratitude and to ensure their loyalty, while the reward-goers decided to exile Jeremy. On the yacht, Jon and Jaclyn were thankful for Jeremy and Natalie's sacrifice, but understood that it was still a game move. On Exile Island, after an unsuccessful idol hunt, Jeremy had to endure two restless, rainy nights, which left him drained of energy and suspicious that Jon had found the idol; back at camp, Jon was worried about Jeremy's return for that very reason.\n\nImmunity challenge: Only using their feet, the castaways would unspool a rope to release a pile of blocks and then, still only with their feet, stack the blocks into three rows on a rotating circular platform.

Then, they would swim out and untether puzzle pieces. Once all four teammates retrieved their puzzle pieces, they would have to find the key that unlocks the puzzle's base, and then assemble the statue puzzle.

At Tribal Council, Reed went along with pretending that he was voting against Keith and Wes, prompting Keith to tell Reed to \"stick to the plan.\" This led to Missy and Jon's alliance whispering amongst each other wondering if Reed and Keith were working together, and if Reed was trustworthy.

The last player remaining would win a horseback ride followed by a barbeque and overnight stay at a resort.After the minority alliance of Reed, Alec, and Keith were eliminated, the remaining five openly began consulting each other to determine the winner and whom to exile. Jeff decided to stop the challenge, as the majority alliance decided to award Missy with the victory. Jon volunteered to be exiled, and Missy was given the choice to take two more castaways with her on the reward; she picked Baylor and Natalie, leaving Jaclyn alone at camp with the minority alliance.

At the reward challenge, the three tribes were redistributed into two tribes of seven: Blue Collar tribe members Dan, Mike, Rodney, and Sierra were joined by Joaquin and Tyler from White Collar, and Joe from No Collar to form the new Escameca tribe, while No Collar tribe members Hali, Jenn, and Will were joined by Carolyn, Max, and Shirin from White Collar, and Kelly from Blue Collar to become the new Nagarote tribe.\n\nReward challenge: Two tribe-mates from each tribe alternated launching balls from a slingshot while the remaining five tribe-mates had to catch the balls with handheld nets; catching a ball would score one point for their tribe. The first tribe to reach five points won a box of kitchen supplies, including pots, pans, oils spices, and sausages, and all of the rewards from the now-abandoned White Collar camp.The new Escameca tribe quickly won the challenge, five points to Nagarote's two. At the Nagarote camp, the former No Collar and White Collar tribe-mates, three people apiece, vied for Kelly's vote; the No Collar alliance took a more laid-back approach, while former White Collar Shirin acted quickly. Later, Shirin's behavior got on her new tribe-mates' nerves. Max was stung on both feet by a stingray; after putting his wart-covered feet in the tribe's cooking pot on Jenn's advice, he was perceived as selfish. At Escameca, Dan, Mike, and Rodney realized that Sierra had all the reason to abandon them for their new tribe-mates, and attempted to bring her back into their fold. Sierra indeed vocalized her desire to align with Joaquin, Joe, and Tyler, though Joaquin and Rodney began to bond. Later, Dan attempted to apologize to Sierra for his previous behavior, but again only further alienated her after ignoring Mike's advice on how to approach her.\n\nImmunity challenge:  Two members from each tribe placed pots on a sled and dragged it through a series of obstacles, placing the pots on stands at the end of the course. Once all eight pots were in place, one tribe-mate used a wrecking ball to smash the pots. The first tribe to smash all eight pots won immunity.Tyler and Joaquin quickly gave Escameca an early lead, which they maintained to handily win the challenge. Back at camp, Shirin and Max targeted Will for his weakness in challenges, telling Carolyn and Kelly their plans. Though Kelly agreed, Carolyn decided to betray her former White Collar tribe-mates, joining the No Collar alliance instead. Kelly, realizing that Carolyn was no longer with Shirin and Max, also abandoned them.

At Escameca, Rodney and Joaquin aligned based on their common lifestyles. \n\nReward challenge: The tribes raced up a tower and through a series of obstacles. At the top, one tribe-mate at a time launched sandbags from a catapult toward targets on the field below. The first tribe to hit all six of their targets won an overnight trip to a turtle sanctuary and enjoyed a feast.Though Escameca was first to the top of their tower, Nagarote came from behind to narrowly win the challenge. On the reward, Shirin bonded with her tribe-mates. The next day, at Escameca, Joaquin tried to align with Sierra; though Sierra was prepared to align with Joaquin and Tyler, she was perturbed by Joaquin's friendship with Rodney. Rodney later plotted with Mike to throw the immunity challenge to get rid of Joe for being a physical and social threat at the merge, which Mike considered in order to protect his closest ally, Kelly, on the other tribe. \n\nImmunity challenge: One castaway from each tribe faced off to memorize a series of six items at a station. Once a castaway thought they had the series memorized, they pulled a handle, concealing the items. The two castaways then ran to a second station to recreate the sequence. The first castaway to correctly recreate the sequence scored a point for their tribe. If neither castaway got the series correct, the castaways repeated the process until one of them succeeded. The first tribe to score three points won immunity.After the tribes were tied with two points apiece, Mike blatantly threw the final match to Kelly to give Nagarote the win.

Realizing that pairs were being targeted, Carolyn planned to downplay her partnership with Tyler going forward. \nAt the merged camp, Mike and Kelly celebrated their reunion as Kelly realigned with her former Blue Collar tribe-mates. Joe rejoined former No Collar allies Hali and Jenn, and the three brought Shirin into their fold. With Kelly noticeably realigning with her former tribe, the alliance of four attempted to align with Tyler and Carolyn instead. Will, the fourth former No Collar, was courted by Rodney, who proposed a final four deal with him, Kelly, and Carolyn. Rodney conspired for the four to initially vote with the Blue Collars but later betray Dan, Mike, and Sierra to avenge Joaquin.

Rodney later blatantly disrespected the minority alliance, and bickered with Shirin over food portioning.\n\nReward challenge: The castaways went across a balance beam to transport three bags of puzzle pieces to a platform. The first three castaways to transport all three of their bags advanced to the next round, where they used the pieces to complete a puzzle shaped like an anchor. The first castaway that completed their puzzle won an afternoon of ziplining followed by a pizza lunch.Joe, Mike, and Hali advanced to the final round, where Joe won his second individual challenge in a row.

Mike, having angered others by initially backing out on buying his letter from home to win the advantage, told his close allies that he had only done so because he had overheard Rodney planning his betrayal, which led to an argument between him and Rodney, and upsetting his allies Dan and Sierra; Mike later joined the minority alliance of Jenn and Shirin.

On the Brains tribe, Debbie was unable to back up her claim about knowing how to make fire without flint, and Aubry, Liz, Neal and Peter formed an alliance against the older Debbie and Joe. Aubry had a panic attack and was consoled by her tribe mates, but they worried about her behaviour. The women of the Beauty tribe—Anna, Julia and Michele—quickly bonded.

At camp, she learned that she had found a \"legacy advantage,\" which would give her an unspecified advantage in the game on Day 36; if she were voted out before then, she would privately will it to someone else following her elimination. Both tribes had difficulties setting up their camps due to a severe storm, even after being given tarps for assistance and shelter. After the storm was upgraded to a cyclone, both tribes were evacuated to a safe location for the night, and returned to their camps the following morning.\nAt the Millennials camp, Zeke led the tribe in building the shelter and making fire.

The player with the most bowls after thirty minutes or the first to stack thirteen bowls on top won immunity.After 30 minutes, Hannah and Ken were tied with 10 bowls each; they then competed in a five-minute runoff, which Ken won. With David vulnerable at that night's vote, Adam and Hannah tried convincing Ken—David's closest ally since the start of the game—to betray David. Though Ken was hesitant, he ultimately joined Adam and Hannah in voting David out at Tribal Council, making David the final member of the jury.\nThe next night, the ten jurors questioned Adam, Hannah and Ken about why they deserved to win. All three were lambasted—Ken for not turning on David until it was too late; Adam for being on the wrong side of several votes; and Hannah for foiling earlier plans to eliminate David despite his status as a threat to win—while Adam was praised for making decisive strategic decisions, though both Hannah and Ken defended their roles in making those decisions. In his final answer of the night, Adam emotionally revealed his mom's cancer diagnosis and how it motivated him to play."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US33","season_name":"Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen X","season":33,"episode":14,"episode_title":"Reunion","episode_label":"Reunion","episode_date":"2016-12-14","episode_length":32,"viewers":6400000,"imdb_rating":7.4,"n_ratings":144,"episode_summary":"Months later, it was revealed that the jury unanimously voted to award Adam the title of Sole Survivor over Hannah and Ken.

He explained to them that they have been divided into three tribes based on the positive traits most associated with them by others: Heroes, Healers, and Hustlers. \n\nReward Challenge: On the beach nearby, each tribe has an urn which is on fire and is 15 feet in the air. Each tribe is allowed to gather as many supplies as they can until Jeff rings the bell on the boat. Then, each tribe must get all six members on their boat and paddle to the beach. When they get to shore, they must lift one person high enough to light their torch. The first tribe to light their torch wins fire in the form of a massive fire making kit that will be waiting for them back at their camp. The second tribe to light their torch will win flint. The losers will go back to camp with no fire-making tools.During the challenge, Ryan found a secret advantage. The Healers and Heroes came in first and second respectively, while the Hustlers went completely off course. The Healers tribe had no problem creating fire with their kit, while Jessica developed an attraction towards Cole. The next day, Mike decided to look for a hidden immunity idol, but Joe became suspicious of Mike's absence and confronted him over what he had been doing. At the Heroes tribe, a majority formed among Alan, Ashley, Ben, and JP, but Alan was at odds with Ashley and JP over their closer bond, calling them a \"power couple\" before accusing JP of having an idol. At the Hustlers tribe, Patrick and Ali aligned, while Ryan learned his \"secret advantage\" was a \"super immunity idol\" that could be played after the votes were read. This advantage could only be used at the first Tribal Council, meaning he would have to anonymously will it to someone on the losing tribe if his tribe won immunity. Ryan informed Devon of this advantage and offered to use it on him in the event they end up at Tribal Council, forming a final 2 deal.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways will race up a cargo net to the top of a tower. Each tribe will then pull a heavy cart up the tower, then hop in and quickly roll down to the bottom. At the bottom will be three different table mazes. The first tribe to reach the mazes will get first choice of which maze they want to tackle. The second tribe will get to choose between the remaining two mazes. The last tribe will be left with the maze that remains. Next, they will work together as a tribe to get their maze to the top of an even taller tower. Once at the top of the tower, two players from each tribe will maneuver three balls through their maze. The first two tribes to finish win immunity.After Ben and Chrissy's poor maneuvering of the maze, the Healers and Hustlers won immunity, sending the Heroes to Tribal Council and forcing Ryan to will his advantage. At the Heroes camp, the majority decided to send Katrina home over Chrissy, but the tension between Alan and Ashley still lingered. Alan later approached Chrissy and Katrina with a plan to vote out Ashley, and tried to convince Ben to join them. Ben tried to assure Alan that Ashley and JP were loyal to them, but Alan was still paranoid about the potential couple. Before Tribal Council, Chrissy learned that she had been given the secret advantage.\nAt Tribal Council, Ashley called Alan out for his irrational behavior, while Alan openly stated that he did not trust Ashley or JP and warned his other tribemates about them becoming a power couple. He also divulged that the initial discussion was between voting out Chrissy and Katrina. Ultimately, the plan to vote out Katrina was followed and she became the first person voted out in a unanimous vote."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US35","season_name":"Survivor: Heroes vs. Healers vs. Hustlers","season":35,"episode_number_overall":480,"episode":2,"episode_title":"I'm a Wild Banshee","episode_label":"Ep 2","episode_date":"2017-10-04","episode_length":43,"viewers":8150000,"imdb_rating":6.8,"n_ratings":119,"episode_summary":"Chrissy felt more secure about her spot in the game after Katrina's elimination. At the Hustlers camp, Simone was pleased with her conquering of the outdoors, but her bragging and laziness set most of her tribemates off, while Ali approached Simone about working together. At the Healers camp, Cole and Jessica bonded over a fishing trip, while Joe began looking for a hidden immunity idol. After misinterpreting the clue as pointing towards the fishing raft, Joe had Cole help him find the idol. At the Heroes camp, JP established himself as the tribe’s provider to keep the target off his back, while Chrissy formed an alliance with Ben after weighing her options. Back at the Hustlers camp, Patrick tried to amuse his tribemates by acting boisterous around camp, but Lauren saw him as too unpredictable to keep around and voiced her concerns to Ali.\n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: Three members of each tribe will swim out to a floating net ring. They will then dive down and maneuver a bundle of puzzle pieces through a cage. Once a tribe has collected all three bundles, the two remaining tribe members will use those pieces to solve a sign post puzzle. The first two tribes to finish win immunity. In addition, the first tribe to finish wins a fishing kit with traps, net, knife, line, lures, and sinkers. The second tribe to finish wins a smaller fishing kit with lines and lures.Despite the Hustlers starting the puzzle first, Simone’s inability to assist resulted in the Healers & Heroes placing first and second respectively. Simone apologized to the tribe for costing them the victory and asked Lauren to join her in voting out Patrick. Patrick and Ryan agreed on voting out Simone, while Ali weighed her options with Ryan.\nAt Tribal Council, Patrick and Simone each pled their case, with Patrick stating tribe strength was important while Simone stated that trust was more important. In an accidental slip-up, Patrick said he could trust most of his tribemates, when he meant to say “all,” raising some concern amongst his tribemates.

At the Heroes camp, Ben and Chrissy were torn between voting out JP or Alan. Ben was wary about JP and Ashley’s perceived status as a power couple, while Alan struggled with camp life. At the Healers camp, Cole and Jessica’s mutual romantic interest continued. Joe believed that Mike would be a unanimous target, but Cole told Jessica about Joe’s idol. After Joe complained about the way Roark prepared food and threw it away instead of offering it to his tribemates, Cole prematurely leaked the idol information to Roark and Desi, to Jessica’s shock and dismay.\n\nImmunity/Reward Challenge: All tribe members race through a series of obstacles. They use sandbags to knock blocks off a ledge. Next, they will stack those blocks one on top of the other. The first two tribes to finish win immunity. In addition, the first tribe to finish wins four live chickens. The second tribe to finish wins a dozen eggs.The Heroes placed first, while the Healers placed second despite forgetting a block. Patrick’s refusal to swap out during the throwing segment led to another loss for the Hustlers, and he apologized for his actions in the challenge. Lauren was angry with Patrick, and the way he responded to her asking if she was the target due to his selfish competitiveness in the challenge set her off even more. Ali, Devon, and Ryan debated whether to vote out Lauren or Patrick.\nAt Tribal Council, Lauren passionately campaigned for Patrick’s elimination. Patrick promised to integrate with his tribe better, but they never gave him the chance; after being voted out unanimously, Patrick had harsh words for his former tribemates as his torch was snuffed, and he became the third person eliminated from the game."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US35","season_name":"Survivor: Heroes vs. Healers vs. Hustlers","season":35,"episode_number_overall":482,"episode":4,"episode_title":"I Don't Like Having Snakes Around","episode_label":"Ep 4","episode_date":"2017-10-18","episode_length":43,"viewers":8120000,"imdb_rating":7.6,"n_ratings":124,"episode_summary":"On day 9, the castaways were surprised when Jeff announced a tribe swap.

They will then use the rope to hook a sled and pull it back to them. The two remaining tribe members will use the pieces on the sled to solve an upright puzzle. The first tribe to finish wins a feast of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and an individual bag of potato chips for each tribe member.By a narrow margin, Jessica and Mike solved their puzzle for Yawa first, winning reward for their tribe. As the new Yawa tribe members got to know each other better, Jessica discovered a secret advantage in her bag of chips that allowed her to block a person from voting, to be used only at the next Tribal Council. She told Cole and Mike to build trust and keep the original Healers tribe intact, but Cole used the information to gain trust with Ben and Lauren, confusing the latter as to why he would tell her about it. She told Mike, who confronted Jessica and Cole about telling Lauren. After initial denials, Cole admitted only to telling Ben, which upset Jessica. At the new Soko tribe, Roark worried about her position within the tribe as the lone Healer, while Ryan and Chrissy aligned after he told her he was the one who gave her the super idol for the first Tribal Council.

Desi tried to convince Joe to give her his idol to gain her trust, while Devon saw that he received Jessica’s advantage, not to be opened until voting took place.\nAt Tribal Council, Joe targeted Ashley as the weakest link, while the old Heroes & Healers each campaigned for Devon’s vote. Devon opened his advantage and was shocked to learn his vote had been blocked. Before the votes were read, Joe stood up to play his idol.

After Chrissy was shut down by Ben about Joe's status as a threat despite being widely disliked, she discussed deviating from Ben's plan and voting out Joe with her allies and Mike.\nBefore Tribal Council started, Mike told Joe to follow his lead. Chrissy confronted Joe about insulting her and Ashley before Mike outlined the hypocrisy in her argument, stating that, by keeping Joe in the game, the rest of the castaways were not playing with moral character. Joe accused everyone else of not playing the game at all, and Mike brought up the fact that the majority had 4 Heroes and 3 Hustlers, meaning the Hustlers would be picked off one by one at that point after voting out the rest of the Healers. Ashley countered Mike's point by outlining that his comment was just as hypocritical as Chrissy's opening one, that nobody is just a number and that morals and relationships do serve a purpose in the game. Before the votes were read, Mike played his idol for himself, but received only 2 votes.

Then, a designated puzzle solver will use the keys to unlock a slide puzzle.  The first person to finish their puzzle wins a massive shelter building kit reward for their tribe.

However, if the tribe leader decides to forfeit the challenge during the puzzle solving portion, their tribe will get to keep the fishing kit, but the opposing tribe will get 20 eggs and flint in addition to the shelter building kit.For Malolo and Naviti, respectively, Michael and Sebastian were selected to run the course, while Laurel and Desiree were selected for the puzzle. Chris pulled the lever on Desiree, preserving Naviti's fishing kit, but giving the larger reward to Malolo. As the Malolo tribe set up their shelter and got to know each other, Jacob openly stated his intention to search for a hidden immunity idol, causing his tribemates to distrust him. He also poured some of the tribe's rice in his dirty sock to see if a clue was hidden in the jar, though there was not.

At the end of the course, they will need to solve a cube puzzle to win immunity.Naviti won the challenge, and also received a flint reward, as Malolo already had flint after winning the first reward challenge. For winning the immunity challenge, Naviti had to send one person from Malolo to Ghost Island, where they would be immune from the vote; Naviti sent Jacob after he declared Malolo was the best tribe in Survivor history. On Ghost Island, Jacob had to break an urn to play a game for an advantage; if he lost, he would have to forfeit his vote at the next Tribal Council. He subsequently won a game of chance which gave him Sierra's legacy advantage from Game Changers. He had to will it to someone from Naviti, and he chose Morgan. He also made a fake idol. At Malolo, the tribe had to come up with a new plan, as Jacob was their intended target. Gonzalez rallied votes against Donathan for being the tribe's weakest link, but at Tribal Council, her paranoia got the better of her as she whispered to her tribemates, asking who they were targeting that night. Although everyone told her they were targeting Donathan, it was revealed that they had lied to her, and Gonzalez was unanimously blindsided, becoming the first person voted out.\nAt Naviti, Domenick searched for a hidden immunity idol in the middle of the night, which he eventually found; it was revealed to be Andrea's idol from Caramoan. The next morning, he attempted to bury the hatchet with Chris, but the tension still lingered between the two. Domenick told Chris he found an idol moments after telling him the opposite, which caused Chris to distrust him. At Malolo, Jacob kept the legacy advantage information to himself and told his tribemates he found an idol on Ghost Island, but that he had left the paper behind, making Brendan suspicious.\n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: Two pairs from each tribe will race through a series of obstacles in the water.

Donathan panicked before eventually diving down and releasing the buoys for Malolo. Naviti sent Donathan to Ghost Island, and the urn he smashed was a dud. At Malolo, Stephanie considered working with Jacob to blindside Michael, but Jacob spilled the beans about the legacy advantage to Stephanie.

At the new Naviti tribe, Chris tried to rally votes against Domenick, but his attitude set Angela and Libby off. Morgan was suspicious of Chris, and she and Libby aligned. At the new Malolo tribe, Bradley's complaining over Malolo's shelter got on some people's nerves, while Michael and Brendan found one of James's idols from China.\n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: Castaways will need to jump between three sets of raised ramps to a sand pit, where they will need to dig out a heavy ladder.

At Naviti, Angela wanted to stay strong with her old tribe members and vote out Libby, but Wendell saw Angela as Chris's \"right-hand man\", and started to rally votes against her.

The first tribe to score three points wins a feast of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with ice cold milk.Before the challenge, Jeff revealed that someone would visit Ghost Island and return before the immunity challenge, meaning they would also be vulnerable if their tribe were to visit Tribal Council. Naviti won the challenge and immediately chose to have Malolo draw rocks; Kellyn was sent to Ghost Island immediately after she explained that being separated was her worst Survivor fear. Although the urn she smashed allowed her to play the game of chance, she decided not to risk losing her vote. At Naviti, a confused and angry Chris learned from Angela about Domenick's alliance's betrayal; they planned on aligning with the former Malolo members, but Donathan talked to Wendell about working together and Laurel talked to Domenick, who revealed his idol to her.\n\nImmunity Challenge: Castaways will have to swim out to a bamboo cage, hop over and dive in the cage to release a door underwater.

Stephanie was put off by Bradley's arrogant attitude and was even more offended when Bradley flat-out told her there was no hope for her alliance. The Naviti majority wanted to weaken the other alliance and Chelsea proposed voting out Michael or Brendan; the Naviti alliance proceeded to debate on which of the two to vote out. Michael revealed his idol to Stephanie and Jenna, which gave the alliance hope. At Tribal Council, Brendan declared Sebastian and Chelsea to be on the bottom of an alliance led by Bradley, and Michael encouraged them to flip after he pulled out his idol, falsely calling it a double immunity idol in an attempt to throw the opposing alliance off their game.

The Naviti majority debated on who to vote out; they decided that Jenna was an easy, safe vote, but Michael was the biggest threat. Jenna flirted with Sebastian to save herself, while Michael pled his case to Bradley, saying they needed him for the challenges. Desiree searched Stephanie's bag for an advantage and didn't find one.

Once through, they navigated a ball up a vertical maze. The first player to get their ball to the top of the maze returned to the game.Rick won the challenge and returned to the game. After the merged tribe, Vata, departed for a celebratory feast, the near-extinct castaways were given the chance to return to the Edge of Extinction to await a second re-entry challenge. All five castaways took the offer but, back at the Edge, Keith and Wendy decided to raise the sail and quit the game. For winning the re-entry challenge, Rick secretly earned two halves of a powerless hidden immunity idol; he was to give one half to another player and, if both players remained in the game following the next Tribal Council, the idol would gain its power. He gave one half to David, his closest ally.

In the meantime, Tommy talked to Janet and Kellee about aligning with Aaron, Missy, Elizabeth, and Elaine, but Kellee was skeptical because she felt those were the four most dangerous players in the game.

Kellee opted not to play either idol, and while Dan received five votes, Missy's turn led to Kellee's elimination.\nAfter Kellee's blindside, Dan quickly tried to learn why he was targeted by Missy, Elizabeth and Janet.

There, Rob and Sandra explained that by grabbing the note, he already lost his vote for the next Tribal Council, but gave him the opportunity to sabotage another player, giving him blank paper and pencil to write anything he wanted. He used the blank paper to create a fake Legacy Advantage, claiming that it could be played when there are 9 or 6 castaways remaining.

The swimmers towed the boat to a tower, where three sets of keys are to be collected. The tribes then headed to a platform, where they used the keys to unlock puzzle pieces. Two members of each tribe then used the pieces to solve a block puzzle. The first tribe to do so won immunity as well as four egg-laying chickens. Beyond the Wheel challenge from Edge of Extinction.Dakal built up a substantial lead on the puzzle as Sele repeatedly struggled to get any of the keys. Adam managed to pull through and get all three himself. Afterwards on the puzzle, Rob and Michele breezed past Nick and Sarah, who had to undo initial piece placement, and won Sele their second challenge. Back at Dakal, Tyson targeted Nick for struggling on the puzzle as it was the same one he succeeded on back in David vs. Goliath. The rest of the tribe considered voting out Tyson. However, Tony wanted to assemble a group of big threats including Sarah, Kim, and Sandra to keep Tyson as shields for themselves. Although Sarah and Kim were on board, Sandra had doubts as she felt Tyson was too dangerous. At Tribal Council, Tyson voted for Nick, who voted for Kim on the chance Tyson had an idol.

Chanelle and Daniel were in the middle between the two pairs of Jenny & Mike and Hai & Lydia.\n\nImmunity/Reward Challenge: Tribe members swam to a marker in the ocean and dove down to retrieve a ladder, which they used to hoist another tribe member to a key, which they used to unlock sand bags when they arrived on land. The first two tribes to land five sand bags on floating platforms won immunity; the first-place tribe won tools and fruit, the second-place tribe won a smaller set of both tools and fruit, while the last-place tribe had to forfeit their flint.Taku easily finished first largely due to Jonathan's efforts, while Vati and Ika struggled in the turbulent waters. Jeff halted the challenge, having the two tribes come to shore while production retrieved their keys in the water and continuing from that point. Ika barely beat Vati for second place. Taku was tasked to send one member from Vati and one from either their own tribe or Ika to the summit; they chose Chanelle and Omar. Though Chanelle expressed the importance of her vote to Omar, she decided to risk her vote, as did he. Jenny and Mike targeted Lydia, while Hai and Lydia targeted Jenny. Chanelle telling Daniel she risked her vote led to some scrambling before Tribal Council, during which Mike and Chanelle could not vote (due respectively to the Beware idol and to unsuccessfully risking the vote). Daniel voted against Lydia to force a 2–2 tie, which was deadlocked after neither Hai nor Daniel switched their vote. Daniel started the ensuing discussion by stating he did not want to go to rocks, leading Hai to declare he would not change his vote. After some arguments amongst the tribe, Daniel ultimately joined Hai in eliminating Jenny."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US42","season_name":"Survivor: 42","season":42,"episode_number_overall":574,"episode":4,"episode_title":"Vibe of the Tribe","episode_label":"Ep 4","episode_date":"2022-03-30","episode_length":43,"viewers":5630000,"imdb_rating":7.1,"n_ratings":148,"episode_summary":"Following Tribal Council, Chanelle told the tribe that Daniel was the one who told her that Mike had found an idol and lost his vote.

From the sled they collected balls and attempted to land all four into a vertical cage target. The first tribe to finish won ten fish.Taku won reward by a landslide thanks to Jonathan's efforts. Other tribe members pointed out Jonathan's dominance in recent challenges. Back at camp, Maryanne and Omar voiced frustration with Jonathan's comment about their tribe being a \"tight four\". Jonathan noted that he could be a shield for others moving forward. \nAt Ika, the tribe was irritated with Rocksroy's bossiness around camp. Due to Drea's extra vote, Swati approached Tori with a plan to bring in Rocksroy. Tori mentioned Drea's extra vote to Rocksroy, who relayed the conversation to Drea. Once it got back to Swati, she became frustrated with her ally for sharing too much information.\n\nImmunity Challenge: Two members from each tribe were tethered to a boat, and hauled the remaining members in the boat through the water to a platform. Two other members leapt into the water attempting to grab keys, before entering the boat again and getting pulled to a floating platform, where they used the keys to unlock puzzle pieces and solve a hanging fish puzzle.

At Vati, Hai and Lydia believed Chanelle was more dangerous, but the tribe questioned whether Daniel’s shoulder injury was as severe as he claimed following a fishing trip. Mike remained reluctant to say his secret phrase and potentially put a target on his back, but all phrases were said at the challenge the next day, putting all three idols in power and giving the respective castaways their vote back.\n\nImmunity/Reward Challenge: Tribes raced over a raised net obstacle before one member untangled a braided rope interlaced with a key via slide puzzle.

She was given a chance for an immunity advantage if she could solve the \"Savvy\" puzzle from day 1, but she chose to protect her vote and not participate. At camp, Julie was revealed to still be holding onto Austin's idol that expired at final 5 (whereas the amulet in Austin's possession expired at final 6), and Drew suggested she make a big move with it, which put Julie on alert. She tried to gather support to vote out Emily.\n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: Castaways untangled rope from a starting point then took it over and under beams once they felt they had enough to make it to a sandbag throwing station. They used three sandbags to knock over lettered blocks, which they used to spell \"resourcefulness\" on both sides forming an arch. The first castaway to successfully spell the word won immunity and a barbeque reward at camp.Drew won the challenge and chose to share the reward with Jake and Austin. They determined that Julie was the biggest threat, while everyone else besides Dee agreed. Austin didn't want to burn the bridge with Dee, so he told her that Julie was the target. Dee then told Julie, who was angry and targeted Austin out of revenge. Dee instructed her to vote for Emily instead, as she didn't want to lose Austin, while she would join the others in voting Julie to not tip off her allies that she told her about the plan. At Tribal Council, Julie played the idol to negate all 6 of her tribemates' votes.

Using the machete they cut a rope dropping a pile of sandbags which they tossed into three baskets releasing a set of numbers.

Austin won the challenge and chose Jake to join him for the reward of a steak dinner at the Survivor Sanctuary. \nKaturah tried to sway people into voting out Dee, while Jake wanted to make a huge impact on the game with his idol. At Tribal Council, everyone that could receive votes received at least one; Jake played his idol for Katurah, but despite her wanting to get Dee out, she switched her vote to send Julie to the jury. Upon returning to camp, Jake was upset that Katurah had made him swear on his family to vote against Dee, leading to an argument.\n\nImmunity Challenge: Castaways had to maneuver through a grid of ropes while using a long pole to place ceramic bowls on a perch. The perch was attached to the rope grid so any disturbance would topple the bowls off the perch.

Back at camp, Katurah, Jake and Austin each had a chance to plead their case with Dee. Dee made it clear she would take Austin, but reconsidered after Austin told her of Jake's lackluster fire making ability. However, she took Austin, and Jake defeated Katurah to send her to the jury.\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Dee and Austin each pled their cases with the moves they made, while Jake's game wasn't as highlighted due to his lack of control. Dee revealed that she did not tell Austin about her telling Julie to play her idol, which swung the jury in her favor.

At Gata, Andy's aggressive attempts to bond with Jon and Rachel were met with skepticism, leaving him feeling alienated, while Jon worried the age gap between himself and the rest of the tribe made him a target. At Lavo, Rome immediately searched for an advantage, but the time away from his tribemates aroused suspicion, though he was able to find the Beware Advantage clue.
