Upon arrival, the Pagong tribe celebrated the beginning of this journey while the Tagi tribe got right to work with Rudy taking command, aggravating some of his tribe members. Richard called for order and structure, to which Susan agreed. Ultimately, they pulled together to assemble a functional camp. At Pagong, B.B. stepped into the leadership role. He and Ramona found the tribe's watering hole, and jokingly agreed to hide it from the group. The next morning, Tagi seemed to be in good spirits as Sonja played her ukulele, though Rudy realized he might need to adapt to the personalities of his younger tribemates. B.B.'s aggressive work ethic grated on Pagong and his tribe's laziness began to frustrate him.\n\nReward/immunity challenge: The tribes were tasked with guiding a lit raft through shallow water. Upon reaching the shore, the competitors must carry the raft above land to the finish line. Along the way were a number of torches that must be lit with the raft's fire, culminating in a final fire bowl in front of a massive bamboo statute that must be set ablaze. The first tribe to light their final bowl won immunity and a reward of waterproof matches.At the first immunity challenge, Tagi took the early lead by guiding its raft through the water. Sonja stumbled as they reached the shore, helping Pagong crawl ahead to light their final torch and win. As a result, Pagong received matches and immunity from that night's Tribal Council. At Tagi's camp, Richard and Rudy bonded while Sean tended to Sonja's injuries. As the first vote approached, Stacey talked of voting out Rudy for being overbearing, but at Tribal Council, a plurality of the tribe instead decided to vote out their choice of weakest link, Sonja."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US01","season":1,"episode_number_overall":2,"episode":2,"episode_title":"The Generation Gap","episode_label":"Ep 2","episode_date":"2000-06-07","episode_length":44,"viewers":18100000,"imdb_rating":7.4,"n_ratings":238,"episode_summary":"Following their Tribal Council, Tagi found its fish traps still empty. Disappointed that Rudy was not voted out, Stacey suggested he was not made for the game, while Rudy believed Stacey wasn't cut out for wilderness survival. Richard revealed to his tribe that he is gay, making Dirk uncomfortable. It didn't discourage Rudy, who still saw Richard as a strong competitor. At Pagong, Ramona was dehydrated and ill while B.B. refused to quit working. Greg and Colleen began to grow close. Greg's evening game showed tribe spirits were high, though B.B. continued to annoy his tribe by washing his clothes in drinking water. At Tagi, Sean crafted a fishing pole to catch food for the group. Both tribes received tree mail, foretelling a disgusting competition. B.B. suggested Pagong throw the challenge to eliminate him, but the tribe refused.\n\nImmunity challenge: One by one, each castaway was given an insect grub to consume. If any individual refused to eat their bug, their tribe would lose the challenge. The tiebreaker saw one member of each tribe (chosen by the opposing tribe) racing to eat two larvae, with the first player to complete the task winning immunity for their tribe.Ultimately, despite Gervase's struggles, everyone was able to eat their assigned grub, forcing each tribe to select one person from the opposite group to eat two bugs in a tiebreaker face-off.

At Pagong, Greg and Colleen found a \"mud volcano\" that the entire tribe was able to enjoy.\n\nReward challenge: Each tribe swam out to an inner tube attached to a sunken treasure chest. Once all the tribe members were at their tube, they would dive down and drag their chest to shore. The first tribe back with their chest would win fishing supplies.Tagi won the reward challenge.

After a tropical storm, Gretchen took a stand and suggested once again that they rebuild their shelter in the canopy away from the beach. Greg appeared to be providing light relief to their tribe, and Gretchen said this would likely get him further in the game. At Tagi, Sean and Dirk spent most of their time fishing, but had no luck; Sean also tried to build a bowling alley. Kelly, Susan, and Richard created an alliance.\n\nReward challenge: The castaways had to make a distress signal. The goal was to make the best S.O.S. signal for the plane (with Jeff in it) to see. The best signal would win the tribe hammocks, towels and pillows, plus two additional items (one chosen by each tribe; Tagi chose a flaying knife, Pagong chose a spice rack). Tagi won the challenge.Immunity challenge: A five-part relay race: The first member swam to a buoy, dove down and retrieved a map in a bottle. The second ran across a floating bridge with the bottle to a waiting boat, where the second and third paddled to shore. The fourth member would break the bottle, check the map, and sprint into the jungle to find a rope ladder and a key. For the final leg, the two remaining tribe members had to locate a buried treasure chest and dig it up. Tagi, being the first tribe to unearth their treasure chest and bring it back to the start line and have the key inside the lock, were the winners.At the immunity challenge, Gervase had problems on the sprint into the jungle, one of the main reasons Pagong lost to Tagi again.

Susan told them it was a waste of time if they weren't catching anything. The tribe were worried about Dirk's weight loss. At Pagong, everyone felt vulnerable because their tribe was getting smaller. Greg and Colleen grew closer, choosing to sleep out in the jungle away from the others. Greg knew he was becoming somewhat of a tribe leader, a role he didn't want.\n\nReward challenge: Tribes selected three tribe members to shoot for the tribe in three rounds. The first one was a blow gun, the second was a slingshot, and the third was a spear toss. The winning tribe would win fruit and chickens.At the reward challenge, Joel helped Pagong win with his spear throwing after the first two rounds were tied. Dirk and Sean began to help around the camp but that didn't change their tribe members' minds, and they remained on the outs. The alliance of four was decided on getting one of them out at the next Tribal Council.

Tagi was afraid due to their numerical deficit, and Rudy agreed to be a part of Richard, Susan, and Kelly's alliance. At Pagong, Joel was confident because his tribe had the numbers, but Colleen thought Joel was an idiot because they weren't merging yet and still had a chance of going in even. Gervase offended the girls by telling them that they were dumber than a cow. One of Pagong's chickens was eaten by another creature. At Tagi, Richard began walking around camp naked.\n\nReward challenge: One at a time, each tribe member raced to a barrack. There were three different items in there (a can opener, a knife, and an Army helmet). The first tribe to get all of their items (with no duplicates) back to the start won a reward of canned foods and a chocolate bar.At the reward challenge, Richard brought back a duplicate knife instead of a can opener and Pagong won by default. At Pagong, Joel tried to create an alliance with the group that would carry over after the merge but was shot down by the women of the tribe. The alliance was interpreted as mean-spirited on Joel's part. Joel started to get a little bossy, which annoyed the girls.\n\nImmunity challenge: Both tribes raced through an Army obstacle course.

They were welcomed by a feast, including lobster and wine, and got to stay the night under a canopy shelter and on beds. The next day, Jenna and Sean decided to live at the Tagi beach and named their merged tribe Rattana. The ten castaways met up and everyone celebrated, except Rudy, who was annoyed because the population doubled.\n\nImmunity challenge: All ten castaways submerged themselves underwater to see how long they could hold their breath. The top three castaways then had another competition of releasing buoys along a ladder submerged underwater. The first castaway to release all of their buoys would win immunity.Greg won immunity after a close battle with Sean.

Richard started to worry about who voted for him at Tribal Council.\n\nReward challenge: Each tribe member was to shoot at an archery target with a bow and arrow. The closest mark to the bullseye won a video from home and the chance to send a video home to them.At the reward challenge, Jeff showed everyone a sneak peek of their videos, except Jenna, because they never received a video for her. Greg went first and no one hit the mark closer, so he won the reward and saw his home video from his sister and sent one back to her. Rudy thought there might be some incestuous behavior between Greg and his sister though clearly took things the wrong way. Jenna was frustrated about losing the reward challenge and instead of watching Greg's video, continued to practice with the bow and arrow, continually hitting the target closer than Greg's mark. People began to realize that Richard liked Greg because of the way he was playing the game. Greg realized that Richard was a powerful player.\n\nImmunity challenge: Each member was connected to a piece of rope and needed to go to the checkpoints in number order (1–6) and collect the color carabiners at each checkpoint and then cross the finish line.Gervase won immunity.

The first castaway to receive all their medallions and get back to the center won a barbecue and letters from home.At the reward challenge, Jenna wanted to win because she hadn't heard anything from her family at the last challenge. It was a race between Colleen and Kelly, which Colleen narrowly won. Jeff told her she could pick one other person and she instantly chose Jenna.

Richard spent his entire birthday naked, which disturbed some of his tribemates, especially Colleen and Jenna.\n\nImmunity challenge: The castaways started on a square and moved one square at a time. As they moved, they had to flip over the square they were just on. Each castaway would go until they could no longer move. Last person standing wins immunity.Rudy won immunity over Sean. Sean was convinced that his alphabet strategy of voting for people was the fairest way and that there was no alliance because he wasn't asked to be a part of it.

He shared his slice of pizza with everyone. While he was making his phone call, Rudy questioned Gervase's life choices, namely having four children out of wedlock, and said that having babies out of wedlock would have never happened when he was his age and that the girl would be \"taken out of town\" and dealt with.\n\nImmunity challenge: Each castaway had a few minutes to grab the kindling necessary to build a fire. They then had to take their torch out to the water to floating woks, light their torch, and bring it back to their pile of wood to start their fire. The first person to burn through their rope won.At the immunity challenge, Richard easily won.

Sean told Kelly he was going to take her for the feast, but chose Richard instead, which infuriated the women. Sean brought his dad back to camp to meet everyone, who attempted to update them on current events and the stock market (although Susan thought he didn't know anything), and before he left he gave each person a care package from their loved ones, which rejuvenated their spirits.\n\nImmunity challenge: Each person stood next to each other on a set of five planks. One plank would be removed over time until they got down to one plank. Whoever stayed on the longest would win.Rudy fell off first. Richard attempted to annoy people off the planks by singing \"99 bottles of beer on the wall\" until he fell off. On the beach, Richard thought it was funny that Colleen was really trying to win immunity when she had no chance of going home tonight because they were going to blindside Kelly. Sean was third to go, followed almost immediately by Susan. Colleen fell off after 2 hours and 54 minutes, giving immunity to Kelly and foiling the Tagi alliance plans.

For their rite of passage, they covered themselves with mud, walked through palm fronds held by locals, passed the torches of their fallen comrades, then passed through a bamboo curtain and walked barefoot through a fire pit.\n\nFinal immunity challenge: Each tribe member held on to the immunity idol while standing on a small log. The person who lasted the longest would win immunity.After two hours of holding on the idol, Jeff tempted the three with oranges. After 2½ hours, Richard gave a speech, said he wouldn't be able to outlast Kelly, and stepped down voluntarily. He said that it was a game of odds and he didn't know what the winner would actually do. After three hours, the remaining two switched positions while keeping their hand on the idol and were to do so every half-hour. While the two were still standing on the pole, Richard spoke of the alliance to Jeff and how he wasn't surprised that Kelly changed her vote. After 4 hours, 11 minutes, Rudy took his hand off the idol while switching spots, and Kelly won immunity yet again. Richard and Rudy each said it was in Kelly's best interest to keep them. At Tribal Council, Kelly voted out Rudy because she thought she might have a better chance of winning defeating Richard than Rudy.\nAt the final Tribal Council, Gervase asked if there were one, two or three things they would change about their time on the island if anything at all. Richard said trusting people so easily, Kelly said making an alliance. Jenna asked who they would put in the final two and why. Richard said Rudy and Greg; Kelly said Sonja and Gretchen. Sean had no questions, but congratulated the two and thanked Kelly for being capable and keeping camp afloat, and told Richard that he enjoyed his company although he played the game differently. Colleen asked what three character traits got them where they were and were essential to get future players to the finals; Kelly said faith, strong will, and likability, while Richard said self-awareness, observation of relationships, and ethics. Rudy said he had nothing to say to those two, but felt dumb after mistakenly removing his hand in the final immunity challenge. Greg had them choose a number between 1 and 10 (Rich said 7; Kelly 3). Susan famously compared Richard to a snake and Kelly to a rat, and declared her intent to vote for Richard. In the end, Rudy, Susan, Sean, and Greg voted for Richard; Jenna, Gervase, and Colleen voted for Kelly.

Ogakor became excited at the thought of a picnic and did yoga to prepare themselves; Kucha was more focused on not having Ogakor win. Ogakor led at the beginning, but Amber veered off track and Alicia and Jeff from Kucha narrowly beat her to the end. Frustrated, Colby filled up a bucket of water and threw it at Jerri.\n\nEveryone at Kucha was relaxing around camp when Michael yelled out in pain and dove into the water. When his tribe asked what happened, he said he took a breath full of smoke and passed out, falling face first into the fire; his hands were burnt with skin hanging off. While his pain intensifying, his tribe watched helplessly from shore and tried to calm him until the medical team could aid him. The medical team arrived in the helicopter, and Michael said his goodbyes to his tribe, all of whom were visibly shaken.

At Ogakor, they waited for information regarding the accident. Ogakor's tree mail told the men to go to the other tribe to scout the other tribe's camp; Kucha's tree mail told the women to go. When Elisabeth and Alicia showed up at Ogakor, they filled the women in on Michael's accident. The women were shocked, but relieved to hear that it was not life-threatening. The Kucha men were surprised to see Keith and Colby and sensed that Keith was the outsider of the tribe.\n\nOn day 20, the tribes merged. They were given 15 minutes to take as much as they could from their old camps. The men were frustrated that they had to move but gathered as much as they could for the hike. They named the tribe Barramundi, after the river fish. An individual immunity challenge followed, with each tribe member standing on top of a wooden pillar in the water, with the last castaway remaining winning immunity. When just Tina and Keith remained, Keith told Tina that he needed the immunity, and Tina stepped down. The five from Ogakor voted for Jeff Varner, while the five from Kucha voted for Colby.

Keith said he realized that it was not about the money and that you should walk away with something much more valuable; Tina said she had learned how much her family means to her; Colby said making the idol made him appreciate and remember why he was there.\nThe final immunity challenge took place at Tribal Council. The contestants had to answer questions about the players who made up the Barramundi tribe. Colby took the lead after 7 questions, but Tina pulled even. After 11 questions, they were tied, but Colby answered the final question correctly, continuing his dominance and allowing him to choose whom to take with him to the final two. Colby chose philanthropy over strategy and picked Tina, making Keith the final member of the jury.\nColby and Tina each pleaded their case for a million dollars. Tina asked the jury not to vote for someone because they got their feelings hurt and that what she was going home to was worth more than a million dollars. Colby said that while he did not beat Tina in strategy, he did everything pretty well. Each member of the jury asked the two contestants a question.

They were divided into two tribes of eight: Maraamu (Tahitian for wind) wearing yellow, and Rotu (Tahitian for rain) wearing blue, and had to paddle two miles to their beaches. Due to the extreme current, the Rotu tribe was making no progress, but by rowing together they started to move. Maraamu noticed that Sarah was not giving an effort into helping row to the beach. After landing on the beach, Sean and Peter had a prayer session out in the water, and Rob M. thought \"they either started playing the game as soon as possible, or they were off their rocker.\"\nRotu tried using their magnifying glass to start a fire, but it was too cloudy to get direct sunlight. They then tried starting a fire with friction, which also didn’t work. As soon as Kathy walked away, some of the tribe voiced their annoyance with her. Hunter look the leadership role at Maraamu, and they got much smoke, and thanks to Peter’s long breaths, they finally got a fire. At night, Rob M. and Sarah’s flirtations had the rest of the tribe talking.\nRotu found a waterfall near their camp, and also found much taro to eat. Maraamu found some grapefruit trees. Rob M. heard a rooster crowing at camp, and went on a wild chase, but it flew away. Hunter thought Rob M. was wasting his time and needed to work on other chores. Back at Rotu, John argued with Kathy about the fire situation, but he felt bad afterward so wanted to start the fire for her, which he and Zoe did. Maraamu found their water source, and Peter thought he was working too hard, so he decided to take a break.\n\nImmunity challenge: Each tribe has an outrigger canoe with two torches. The teams must run down the beach with it and then swim with it out to a wok where they must light both torches, then come back to the beach, lighting four torches along the way. Once they get back to shore, they must sprint along the shore, lighting three more torches, get the canoe back in its stand, and light the final torch.The immunity challenge proved tough. Maraamu was first to the center wok, but had issues lighting their torches, and Rotu took the lead. Things got worse as they dropped one of the torches in the water. Rotu won immunity fairly handily.\nPeter wanted to keep the tribe as strong as possible, and Gina said she was going to vote the way she wanted to vote and that no one would talk her into voting a certain way. Some of the women thought that Peter was strange. Sean thought the more males on the tribe, the better, and he wanted to vote out Sarah. Going into the first tribal council, there were no clear alliances, and a lot of people had no idea who they were voting for.

Rob was also struggling physically due to the lack of food. Some of the males made traps and fishing gear to try and catch some protein. At Maraamu, Hunter, Rob M. and Sean’s morning show was entertaining the tribe, and put them in high spirits. Patricia, or \"Momma\" as she was nicknamed by the tribe, stepped up around camp. John wanted to be as high as possible on the pecking order, and caught a shrimp with the trap that he made. Almost immediately after, Kathy called the tribe over as she found a trove of shells and crabs. Back at Maraamu, Patricia’s hard work turned into bossiness, which rubbed some people the wrong way. Sean and Vecepia bonded over their culture and love for God. Although Sean looked physically strong, Gina and Hunter noted his laziness around camp. They also noticed that Rob M. and Sarah were spending a lot of time together, and Hunter thought that if Sarah were to go, they could get more productivity out of Rob M. Again back at Rotu, Kathy wanted to have a meeting about the shelter because there wasn’t enough room for everyone. Gabriel fought back a little, saying that she wasn’t putting forth the effort to get to know everyone. Still, they redid their shelter to include everyone.\n\nReward challenge: Each tribe has a boat anchored at the bottom of the ocean floor with about 250 rocks inside. They must dive down and remove as many rocks as possible until the boat floats to the surface. Then, they must bail enough water as they determine necessary and paddle to the beach. The winning tribe receives fishing gear: mask, snorkel, and fins.While Maraamu only sent down one or two people at a time, Rotu went down in groups. They finally sent a group down to flip the boat instead; it worked and rose to the surface. Maraamu followed suit, rising their boat to the surface. While Rotu flipped their boat on their dock, Maraamu flipped it in the water and had to bail water out. That gave Rotu the advantage, and they ran their boat to their mat, giving them their second straight win.\nBack at Maraamu, Sarah voiced her opinions about the shelter, but no one wanted to listen to her because she wasn’t willing to put in the effort to do it herself.\n\nImmunity challenge: One at a time, each tribe member must bob for a piece of fafaru (marinated fish bones, crab and lobster legs) and eat it without throwing up.After 8 rounds, every person had eaten their piece, each tribe had to select a member of the other tribe to do the tiebreaker. Rotu chose Rob M. and Maraamu chose Neleh to do the tiebreaker. While both had problems, Rob M. threw part of his up and Neleh got hers down first, giving Rotu another win.\nAt tribal council, Sarah admitted she did less work in order to conserve energy at the challenges, to which Gina responded that if she has to pick up people’s slack at camp, she is twice as tired at the challenges. Although Sarah received three votes, an early alliance was formed as Vecepia, Sean, Rob M., and Sarah voted out Patricia due to her overall bossiness and per their alliance."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US04","season":4,"episode_number_overall":45,"episode":3,"episode_title":"No Pain, No Gain","episode_label":"Ep 3","episode_date":"2002-03-13","episode_length":43,"viewers":20460000,"imdb_rating":7.7,"n_ratings":125,"episode_summary":"After Maraamu’s vote, Sarah got upset about people saying she didn’t do work around camp, and an argument broke out.

He became the father figure around camp. John landed on a sea urchin and needed someone to pee on his hand, which Kathy did. The Maraamu members were having big issues with the nonos, which were biting them horribly. While moving the bamboo poles for their raft up to camp, Robert stepped on a rock and sliced the bottom of his big toe open, which John took care of. Later on, John got bitten by an eel while looking for food, which gave him a deep cut on one of his fingers.\n\nReward challenge: Each tribe has to construct a raft from bamboo and rope that can fit 6 members and other supplies. Each tribe has to paddle in a criss-cross fashion to five boxes that are anchored to the bottom of the ocean. The winning tribe receives blankets, pillows, and three lanterns, or a week’s worth of rice.At the reward challenge, the tribes were relatively even, and collided in the middle of the course.

At Maraamu, they found tons of crabs and were able to make an entire pan full of crab meat.\n\nReward challenge: Fourteen pieces belonging to four tikis are scattered on a course. One member will guide three blindfolded members to the fourteen pieces. Once all pieces are back, the four tikis must be reconstructed. The winning tribe gets to raid the losing tribe’s camp.At the reward challenge, Gabriel and Kathy were chosen as the eyes for their tribe. Rotu took an early lead and had 13 pieces, but could not find the last piece. Maraamu made up the difference and collected all their pieces first. Rotu eventually found their last piece, but Maraamu was too far ahead. Maraamu won by a landslide, giving the tribe, and Gina, their first win. They had two minutes to raid Rotu's camp, and nearly every reward item Rotu had won ended up with Maraamu.\nJohn noticed Gabriel bonding with the three original Maraamu members. When he approached him about his voting strategy. When Gabriel said he didn’t have one and that he would only tell John who he was voting for beforehand, John did not feel comfortable and said that Gabe was no longer safe, and that he wanted to get rid of him. John concocted an alliance of himself, Robert, Zoe, and Tammy. In order to avoid a tie, John approached Sean about voting for Gabe as well.\n\nImmunity challenge: Each tribe must build a distress signal without using fire to signal a ship from a distance.Maraamu’s raid proved useful as they used a lot of the supplies taken from Rotu to help their signal. Rotu quickly realized that all three of the former Maraamu members were participating in the challenge, which worried Robert. Rotu built a signal with their raft and their life jackets, but the captain said he didn’t think it was a very good signal. Maraamu used the insides and outsides of their life-jackets, Paschal's American flag, and their white blankets to create moving signals. The captain said that Maraamu’s distress signal was much more obvious, and Maraamu won their second challenge and their first immunity.\nJohn continued to talk to the other members of Maraamu to get rid of Gabriel, but Rob had other plans and considered getting rid of John. After talking to Rob, Gabriel weighed his options of continuing to play his game or by joining forces. John worried that he may have hatched his plan too early and thought he may be going home. However, Gabriel’s apathetic attitude toward playing the game cost him and he was unanimously voted out. Despite voting against Gabriel himself, Rob told John he was coming after him."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US04","season":4,"episode_number_overall":48,"episode":6,"episode_title":"The Underdogs","episode_label":"Ep 6","episode_date":"2002-04-04","episode_length":43,"viewers":22170000,"imdb_rating":7.9,"n_ratings":123,"episode_summary":"With Gabriel gone, John takes charge at Rotu, and the four original Rotu members (John, Robert, Tammy, and Zoe) agree to stick together to the final four.

The first runner races through the jungle, unties a paddle, and tags the second runner. Both then race to untie a second paddle, and then race back to the beach where they break open coconuts to find a key. The two runners pass the paddles and the key to two other tribe members, who must unchain a boat, paddle the boat out to retrieve a flag, then paddle back to plant their flag in the tiki. When the paddlers return to shore, they must push their boat to their chain and both paddlers must be present at the tiki when they put their flag in. The winning tribe receives a meal of chicken, quiche, bean salad, dessert, and Sierra Mist.At the reward challenge, the Maraamu tribe is shocked to see that Gabriel was voted out. Rob and Zoe easily beat Paschal and Neleh in the jungle portion of the race, however John and Robert have difficulty paddling together, allowing Gina and Kathy to overtake them on the water, retrieving their flag first. However, John and Robert manage to catch up as the boats are heading back. Gina and Kathy forget to take their flag as they ran to the finish, allowing John and Robert to put their flag in the tiki first. Jeff announced that Rotu won the challenge; but Maraamu protests, claiming Robert was not at the tiki before Gina and Kathy put their flag in after John. Jeff then goes to the boats to see if they were in reach of their chains. Maraamu's boat was okay, but Rotu placed their boat too far from their chain. Jeff then stated the Maraamu was correct and that Robert had to be at the tiki with John. Jeff corrects his statement and declares Maraamu the winning tribe.\nBack at the camps, Maraamu feasts while Rotu declares it didn't really need food and that the Maraamu members would just make themselves sick eating all that food. Paschal is disappointed that Rotu turned on Gabriel, and he and Neleh bond with Gina which concerns Kathy. Rob confronts Zoe about being in an alliance, which she denies. He then confronts John who confirms that the original four Rotu members are sticking together.

Each tribe later gets a tree mail message telling them they have five minutes to select one member to hike to a destination unknown. Rob volunteers to go for Rotu, while Kathy is picked to go for Maraamu.\nRob and Kathy eventually cross paths with one another and meet Jeff at a meeting place called a Tohua. Jeff explains to the two of them that by being sent there, they have been chosen as ambassadors who will be responsible for the upcoming tribal merge. Both would spend the night there to discuss tribal situations, decide on the new tribe's name and paint the new tribe's flag. After leading both ambassadors to a picnic table, Jeff surprises them with a feast of pizza and beer. As they eat, Rob shocks Kathy by telling her that her old tribemates from Rotu plan on aligning with him, Sean and Vecepia to target the remaining Maraamu members upon the merge.

Upon arrival at Rotu, Kathy, Neleh, Paschal and Rob receive a big welcome from everyone else. Despite being glad to see everyone, Kathy was hesitant due to what Rob told her the night before. When Rob gathers everyone else around, he passes out the new purple buffs, presents the new tribe's flag revealing the new tribe's name as Soliantu (meaning \"Sacred Allegiance to the Sun\"). Shortly after settling down from all the excitement, things are back to business as usual. Kathy approaches Paschal and explains why she feels vulnerable.

The message instructs the players to make their own kites for the next reward challenge. As the tribe works away, Kathy believes the next thing to do is to target players who were originally on Maraamu prior to the tribal switch, but wishes she could eliminate John and Tammy instead. Kathy approaches Paschal hoping to convince him that targeting stronger players was the way to ensure them a longer stay in the game.\n\nReward challenge: Each player has a kite (which they made themselves prior to the challenge). The first player to get their kite 300 feet in the air wins a king-size Snickers candy bar and a scuba diving trip at a coral reef.During the challenge, several players find it difficult to get their kites up, but Kathy's kite rises above all others, clinching her another victory.\nWhile Kathy is out scuba diving, voting strategies are being made as Neleh and Paschal align with John, Robert, Tammy and Zoe planning to vote out Sean at the next tribal council. When Kathy returns, she shares her Snickers bar with her tribemates. Although all are appreciative of Kathy to do so, John is not impressed saying that his share of Kathy's bar is not enough to change his vote. Sensing vulnerability, Sean urges Kathy to vote with him hoping that Neleh and Paschal will follow suit. Kathy agrees with Sean theorizing that John and Tammy are playing in such a way that would make them difficult to vote out. However, Neleh disagrees with Kathy explaining that there will always be alliances and that the more you speak out, the more vulnerable you become. Despite Kathy telling him that she refuses to be a pawn to help John and Tammy make it to the final day, Paschal chooses not to align with Sean and Vecepia. John feels confident that Neleh and Paschal are supporting him.\n\nImmunity challenge: The players are asked questions about surviving on the Marquesas Islands.

It was a frantic race, but due to Sean draining a huge coconut early on, he and Paschal come out on top and win the reward. The next day, Paschal and Sean were taken by helicopter to a mountaintop where they met two Marquesan tribesmen who, despite Sean's anxiety, have them mount on horses and journey to where their feast will take place.

Once a question is asked, the players must write down their answers and reveal them once all four have finished writing. Each player gets one point per correct answer. Whoever scores ten points first wins.The first of several questions that they are asked is a two-parter to which Neleh gets two points on, while everyone else get one point apiece. Although the lead is tied for most of the game, Vecepia is the first to reach ten points, winning her individual immunity. Shortly before the vote, Kathy negotiates with Vecepia by asking her to keep her immunity but not vote against her in order to force a tie. Vecepia accepts Kathy's offer and casts the deciding vote against Neleh. The vote is tied as Kathy and Neleh receive two votes each. Jeff then reveals that in the tie-breaker previous tribal council votes do not count nor do questions and answers as opposed to previous seasons. Instead, the players are given two minutes to discuss who should be next to go  and come to a unanimous decision as to whether Kathy or Neleh will be voted out. Failure to finalize such decision means all but Vecepia picking colored rocks (two yellow, one purple) out of a bag. Picking the purple rock means being the next to go. After the discussion, no decision is made. So Jeff brings the bag around and one at a time, Neleh, Kathy and Paschal reach into the bag and pull out a rock. When Jeff signals the three of them to reveal their rocks, Kathy and Neleh each had a yellow rock, leaving Paschal with the purple rock. Therefore, Paschal, despite never receiving one vote at previous tribal councils, is the next player eliminated and becomes the sixth member of the jury.\nAt 3:00AM the next morning, Jeff comes to Soliantu and wakes up the final three players and lets them know of the day ahead of them. Upon conclusion of the description, Jeff gives the final three players a map to where they will later journey to before leaving them to assemble an outrigger canoe. With their canoe completed, Kathy, Neleh and Vecepia paddle to the other side of the island. Shortly after reaching shore, they find a mat with brushes and black body paint with which they paint symbols and personal images on their bodies similar to the tattoos worn by local Marquesan tribesmen. Once painted, they hike along a high ridge where they encounter the torches of the first thirteen players eliminated from the game and reflect on the time they spent with them. After passing all thirteen torches, the final three players hike to an area of purification where, after saying a prayer, they bathe to cleanse their spirits using a mixture of oils and spices. As their cleansing ritual commences, Kathy reflects on herself and the other two remaining players and finds it amazing that the three of them have made it to Day 38 in spite of their different ways of life. After adorning themselves with flowers, the three remaining players hike the rest of the way and meet Jeff for the final immunity challenge.\n\nImmunity challenge: The final three players stand on two logs and lean forward to have one hand on the immunity idol. If a player lets go of the idol, lifts up one foot or touches the idol or supporting tiki with their free hand, they are out of the game. The last player standing wins.The challenge goes long into sundown. About four and a half hours into the challenge, Neleh suggests that Kathy fixes her top. Doing so with her free hand causes Kathy to lose her balance and fall off her logs, putting her out of the game. After Kathy limps off to the side, Vecepia tries to make a deal with Neleh by asking if she will take her to the final two if she steps off. Neleh agrees and Vecepia steps off her logs, giving Neleh individual immunity.\nWhen the final three players arrive at tribal council, they notice that Paschal is not among the members of the jury. Jeff explains that Paschal collapsed before tribal council was to start and had been evacuated to medical care. Having witnessed the incident and being a registered nurse, John is asked by Jeff to explain what happened. John explains that Paschal fainted on his feet and showed signs of dehydration but was within normal limits, talking, alert and knew where he was. Kathy, Neleh and Vecepia are relieved when John assures them that Paschal will be fine. The three of them move on to discuss what happened at the immunity challenge. Kathy admits her mistake by trying to fix her top and falling from the logs as a result, leading Vecepia to make her deal with Neleh, much to the jury's chagrin when Jeff points it out. Neleh explains that she accepted Vecepia's offer because she was convinced that she would be the next to go if she didn't win. Before long, Jeff sends Neleh to cast the one vote to determine who will be the final player to be eliminated from the game. When Jeff tallies Neleh's vote, it is revealed that Kathy is the final player voted out of the game and the seventh and final member of the jury. Neleh and Vecepia thus became the first final two who originally started on two different tribes.\nUpon returning to camp from tribal council, Neleh and Vecepia tend to their fire where they later sit by and pray for Paschal's health before turning in for the night. Shortly after waking up to their final morning and preparing breakfast, the final two players notice a pig and two chickens near their camp. The two of them later take their last mud bath in the shallow waters near their beach. When they return to shore, they start up a bonfire and ceremoniously burn unwanted clothes left behind by their former tribemates. All the while, the two finalists are curious as to how the jury will interpret their methods of gameplay. Vecepia hopes the jury will define her methods as strategic, decisive and partly deceiving, while Neleh hopes that the jury will know that she has been upfront and honest. Both ladies somberly take one last look at the ocean before hiking to their final tribal council.\nEach jury member has different feelings about the events leading to the final day. Paschal feels that the game was played honestly and does not know what caused Neleh and Vecepia to make it so far other than luck. Kathy cannot process the game and has not focused on whom to vote for. Zoe thinks it is best to have an all-woman's final and that both Neleh and Vecepia are deserving of the million dollars. Despite not feeling so good about Neleh and Vecepia being the final two and that they lasted longer than him, Robert sees his jury vote as a coup for himself. Sean says that the money will not be swayed by his preference for race and thinks the best player should win regardless. Unable to feel the jury's power until joining the jury herself, Tammy does not think that Neleh nor Vecepia deserve to win the money and must decide who played best and deceived her the least. John feels that how the final two will react to his statement will determine who gets his vote.\nWhen Neleh and Vecepia arrive at their final tribal council, they are glad to see Paschal back on his feet and among the rest of the jury. After explaining the procedure, Jeff has both finalists make their opening statements. Neleh states that she has had an incredible time, that everything she did for the other players was out of love, that she gave everything 100% and loves them regardless of their vote. Vecepia states that she wanted to have a strategy, develop relationships, avoid riding other players' coattails and prove herself with her work ethic, spirituality and gumption to be her best.\nThe jury then approaches Neleh and Vecepia with questions and comments. Tammy states that she was going to lie, cheat and do what she could to win but changed her strategy because she felt bad about her gameplay because of Neleh and Vecepia's \"holier-than-Thou\" attitude. Tammy considers the two finalists as hypocrites and possibly the biggest liars due to condemning herself along with John, Robert and Zoe for being manipulative only to be the same way behind their backs through Christianity. Tammy feels that Kathy deserves the million dollars more than Neleh and Vecepia but congratulates them anyway for beating her at her own game. Sean asks the final two if there was a moral message they gained gameplay. Neleh says that at times, she wanted to follow her heart but felt she couldn't due to an alliance she had made and learned to always follow her heart. Vecepia, on the other hand, says that when in a situation, she will think it through before giving her word. Paschal considers both finalists deserving of making it to the end, the epitome of what America has to offer and would have been glad to have had either of them as his daughters. Robert asks the finalists if there was any decision they made or action they took that could be their downfall. Vecepia says that she regrets what she did to Kathy, while Neleh says that she regrets Robert and Zoe leaving when they did. Zoe believes that both Neleh and Vecepia are good-hearted and congratulates them for making it to the end. Kathy asks Neleh which point in the game she did her most dramatic strategic movement, what her decision was and when and the decision she made herself. Neleh explains that she really started playing on Day 24 when she along with Kathy, Paschal, Sean and Vecepia started targeting the Rotu alliance of John, Robert, Tammy and Zoe. Kathy then asked Vecepia how she could go on playing the game by adjusting alliances and not feel part of such cunning manner to which Vecepia explains that her strategy was to wait for people to approach her. After angrily stating how he feels about integrity and stating that both of them lied, John asks why he should vote for either finalist. Neleh states that she was going to join his alliance with Robert, Tammy and Zoe hoping that somehow she would finish further than fifth place but chose not to due to finding out that would not happen. Vecepia states that John knew she came in with a strategy and played the game at her best to get to the end.\nIn conclusion, Vecepia stated that regardless of she and Neleh responded to what the jury had to say, that the jury finds the answers to decide justly. Neleh asked the jury to consider how she treated them, her love and compassion and that luck got her to the end. Shortly afterwards, the jury casts their vote for who they feel deserves the million dollars. Once the votes are cast, Jeff retrieves the voting urn but does not tally the votes right away saying that they will be tallied after they return to the United States. Jeff then leaves the tribal council area, boards an arriving helicopter and flies away."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US04","season":4,"episode":15,"episode_title":"The Reunion","episode_label":"Reunion","episode_date":"2002-05-19","episode_length":34,"viewers":17890000,"imdb_rating":5.4,"n_ratings":147,"episode_summary":"Months later, Jeff arrives in New York City in the same helicopter he left the tribal council area in with the voting urn in hand, Jeff hails a taxicab which takes him to Central Park where the two finalists and the seven members of the jury await him on a big stage before a live audience of cheering fans. Shortly after building suspense, Jeff tallies the jury's votes. Neleh receives the votes of Kathy, Paschal, and Zoe, but in the end, Vecepia receives the votes of Sean, Robert, Tammy, and John and is declared the winner of the million dollars and the title of Sole Survivor.  The jury confirmed Kathy would have won easily over both Vecepia and Neleh, beating both 6-1, with only Paschal voting Neleh, and only Sean voting Vecepia.\n\nThe castaways return to discuss the season, hosted by Rosie O'Donnell.

Meanwhile, the men planned to vote out Jenna next. \n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways must navigate through a maze blindfolded. The first castaway to retrieve four necklaces at stations within the maze and then return to the center of the maze wins immunity.The men's plan to eliminate Jenna was thwarted after she won the challenge, keeping her safe from the vote. After returning to camp, Matthew and Rob discussed voting out Butch. Later on, Matthew formed a secret alliance with Jenna to take her to the final two. Although Jenna was interested in siding with Butch, the tribe unanimously voted him out, sending him to the jury 3-1.\nAfter eating breakfast, the final three castaways were shocked to find a bathroom scale in their Tree Mail. The three castaways each stepped on the scale and discovered how much weight they had lost over 38 days. Later on, Jeff arrived at the Jacaré camp and instructed the castaways to board a seaplane, where they would get an aerial view of the Amazon. Once finished, they were instructed to paddle to Tribal Council, where they would compete in the final immunity challenge. \n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways must balance themselves on a narrow wooden perch while holding a headdress over their head. They have a bead necklace attached to the headdress, which prevents the castaways from holding the headdress too high. The last castaway standing wins immunity.During the challenge, Matthew was the first to fall off the perch. Rob offered to take Jenna to the final two if she stepped down. However, Jenna declined Rob's offer. Jenna ended up outlasting Rob, guaranteeing herself a spot in the final two. At Tribal Council, Jenna ended up voting out Rob, who she felt was more of a threat to win the game than Matthew.\nOn their final day at the Amazon, Jenna and Matthew reminisced about their eliminated tribemates and wrote each castaway's name on their supply crate. Matthew, wanting to add closure to their experience, brought the tribe's boat to shore and placed the camp artifacts inside. Matthew then set the contents on fire and sent the boat down the river.\nAt the final Tribal Council, Jenna stated to the jury members that they knew who she was. Matthew stated that he was dedicated to the tribe, that he was a serious competitor, and that he played with honor and integrity. Butch asked Jenna and Matthew if they had lied to or deceived any of their tribemates. Jenna responded by claiming she had lied to Deena, who she felt had betrayed their alliance. Matthew claimed that he had lied to Alex and Roger in order to save himself. Rob asked the final two castaways why the other finalist didn't deserve to be sitting next to them. Matthew responded by saying that Jenna did not contribute much around camp and that she had the desire to quit. Jenna responded by saying that Matthew hadn't been playing the game, didn't need the money, and that it was \"just another adventure on his list of things to do\". Alex stated to the finalists that the words \"honesty\" and \"integrity\" didn't mean anything to him anymore. He asks them about their biggest regret. Jenna says it was putting trust in untrustworthy people. Matthew says it was his decision to support Ryan at the first vote.\nNext up was Heidi, who asked the finalists whether they felt there was someone else more deserving of being in their position. Both Jenna and Matthew answered Rob. Deena was concerned about Jenna's statement that Matthew didn't need the money, and wonders if they should vote on need and not gameplay. Jenna responded that if she were on the jury, she would vote on need, but understands that others may feel differently. Deena then stated to Matthew that she was offended by the comment \"may the best man win\" he made at an earlier Tribal Council. Matthew apologized to Deena. Next up was Christy, who asked the finalists what their reactions were when they learned she was deaf. Matthew responded by claiming he thought she had a \"funky accent\". Christy demanded an explanation from Jenna about her comment that she, Jenna, was \"handicapped because she was beautiful\". Jenna claimed that she didn't remember making that comment, but says she feels others judged her as not smart or strong because she's a swimsuit model. Last up was Dave, who asked which influential leader a castaway should emulate in the game. Matthew answered Colin Powell, while Jenna chose her mother for \"her fight and strength\". In his closing speech, Matthew admitted that he had lied along the way, however mentioned that it was part of the game. Jenna mentioned that she had come through in the end when she needed to save herself."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US06","season":6,"episode":15,"episode_title":"The Reunion","episode_label":"Reunion","episode_date":"2003-05-11","episode_length":35,"viewers":17650000,"imdb_rating":6.6,"n_ratings":236,"episode_summary":"Months later, it was revealed that the jury gave Jenna the title of Sole Survivor, along with the million dollars.

Host Jeff Probst threw the contestants' sneakers overboard, and they were given a sack of Panamanian currency. The two tribes, Morgan and Drake, were sent to buy surviving essentials at a local village. When they reached the village, Morgan was scrambling to get supplies, while Drake was more successful, as Sandra was able to speak Spanish with the locals. Morgan had left their shoes unattended, so Rupert took the opportunity to steal their shoes so he could buy goods for his tribe. Meanwhile, Morgan member Osten traded all of his clothing, except for his boxers to buy goods for his tribe. After they were finished buying goods, the tribes got on their marine vessels and traveled to their respective islands. On Night 1, Morgan had trouble sleeping, as rocks were falling from above, and crabs were biting the members. Meanwhile, Drake decided to celebrate their new home by drinking Panamanian wine, which they had bought at the village. Jon became incredibly drunk, which annoyed his tribemates.

After they had lost, the Morgan tribe was upset, but Andrew tried to cheer his tribe up by giving them a pep talk. Lill was at risk of possibly being voted out because she was the oldest woman, and therefore considered to be potentially a liability at future challenges, and Nicole wanted to oust Tijuana, but when Lill told Tijuana of Nicole's plan, Tijuana decided she couldn't trust her.

Once all the items are in the chest, the contestants, as a tribe, must grab the chest and swim it to the shore. First tribe to bring their chest to the shore wins reward.

Morgan never recovered, giving Drake their second win in a row. In a twist, the winning tribe, Drake, had to send one member to the Morgan camp to take one of their items back with them. Drake sent Sandra, who chose to take Morgan's tarp. Morgan was sullen around Sandra and after they snapped at her for taking the tarp and asking them to help so she didn't damage their shelter doing so, Sandra simply tore the tarp down and left the shelter in bad shape, ignoring Morgan's whining and leaving without any pleasantries. While trying to rebuild their shelter, Osten announced that he was considering quitting the game, which upset Andrew.

Rupert searched underwater for the lost head, and wound up finding it. \n\nImmunity challenge: Each tribe would capture three members of the opposing tribe.

With all three pieces, Drake had a good idea where to look for the treasure. They got somewhat confused when they had to find a spot on the map called \"Devil's Fork\". Drake was overcome with joy when Shawn hit the treasure chest with the shovel. The tribe gathered to see what the chest contained. Inside, there were goblets, candles, candleholders, canned foods, sugar, honey, blankets, coffee beans, and chocolate.

The tribes received Tree Mail with paint in the color of their tribe. Mogo Mogo decided to save the paint, while the Chapera tribe used it to paint each other's bodies. As the tribes assembled for a reward challenge, they were told that there was no challenge. Instead, members of Chapera and Mogo Mogo were instructed to pair off and enjoy a picnic. After the castaways completed their picnic, they thought that they were going to merge, but instead discovered they were actually switching tribes. The castaways were instructed to draw a random buff from a vase. By chance, each castaway was switched to the opposite tribe, with the exception of Amber, who remained on the Chapera tribe with the four former Mogo Mogo tribe members. With Amber now on the opposing tribe, Boston Rob was upset to be separated from her. The new Chapera tribe, consisting of the entire former Mogo Mogo tribe and Amber, was impressed by their new camp. The new Mogo Mogo tribe, consisting entirely of former Chapera tribe members, was disappointed with their new home.  Prior to the immunity challenge, Boston Rob expressed his desire to go the final two with Amber and would do whatever it would take to get her there.  Rob decided that he needed to make a big move that would affect everybody. \n\nImmunity Challenge: The tribes must answer questions about Survivor from season one to season seven.

The castaways were asked to list the first castaways voted out in the first seven seasons. Chapera answered six out of seven correctly, however Mogo Mogo got all seven correct, winning immunity. As the tribes gathered to return to their camps, Boston Rob approached Lex and offered him a deal, \"You take care of her, I'll take care of you.\"  Lex promised that he would do his best.

Boston Rob promised to keep him safe, however later revealed that he never had any intention of keeping his deal with Lex and that it was all a game so that Amber could stay. Boston Rob then approached Amber to tell her that Lex was going next.  Amber was hesitant, as she had promised Lex and Kathy that Boston Rob and her would be the final four. Amber didn't want to break her word just yet and tried to convince Rob that they should play it safe by eliminating Jenna or Rupert but Boston Rob felt that Lex was too big a threat to keep around. \n\nImmunity Challenge: The men and the women competed separately for immunity.

Kathy was also upset at Boston Rob for going back on his word.  Extremely angry, Lex yelled at Boston Rob that he had compromised his numbers at the merge by honoring his word with Boston Rob. Boston Rob realized that had Jerri stayed and Amber gone, Big Tom may have possibly switched sides.

However, one member will be voted out from the winning tribe before the reward is distributed.Though Ulong had an early lead, Ibrehem had difficulty in swimming, thus giving another win for Koror. \nAt Koror, the alliance of Tom, Ian, Gregg, Jenn, and Katie targeted Willard as Tom thought that Willard would take one of the spots at the Final Tribal Council, but Coby and Willard wanted to vote out Katie. Later that day, Gregg approached Coby about joining forces with Janu and Jenn to eventually blindside Tom and Ian, which Coby agreed to. \nLater at Koror's first Tribal Council, Willard was perceived as weak and a freeloader and was voted out unanimously. While watching Ulong's fifth straight Tribal Council, it was revealed that Koror will vote again, this time to give immunity to one of the Ulong. Knowing Ibrehem was Ulong's worst performer in the reward challenge, Koror granted Ibrehem individual immunity in a 3–2–2–1 vote (with Bobby Jon and Stephenie both have 2 votes and Angie with 1). Ulong's vote was originally a tie as Angie and Stephenie voted against Bobby Jon, Bobby Jon and James voted against Angie, and Ibrehem against James, causing a revote. In the end, Ibrehem and Stephenie changed their votes to Angie and she was voted out unanimously.

The next day, Katie and Tom ceremoniously burned their shelter and everything that helped them survive the past 39 days. In the Final Tribal Council, Tom was commended for his dominance in challenges and leadership skills; but was berated for being overbearing and a sexist. Katie on the other hand praised for her honesty, but was lambasted for being two-faced, weak in challenges and riding on Ian and Tom's coattails.

Alex, Edgardo, and Mookie told Dreamz that they found the hidden immunity idol at Ravu, which caused Dreamz to waver because they kept it a secret from him.\nDreamz jumped sides and told Cassandra, Earl, and Yau-Man that Mookie had found an Immunity Idol; Cassandra responded, \"Mmmhmm\". Initially, the group of Boo, Cassandra, Dreamz, Earl, Stacy, and Yau-Man decided to target Alex. Feeling threatened, Alex asked Mookie to discreetly give him the hidden Immunity Idol for protection at Tribal Council. Dreamz noticed this exchange and told the Earl's alliance of the swap, and the same group decided to change the target to Mookie. Edgardo later suggested to the Four Horsemen that they vote off Cassandra instead, as she was a strong middle player in the game and if Earl did have the Immunity Idol, their plan may backfire. Seeing that Dreamz may have been playing both sides of the game and hoping to improve her standing with her critical teammates, Stacy suggested to Boo, Cassandra, Earl, and Yau-Man that they vote off Edgardo and not tell Dreamz about this change; regardless of whether Alex and Mookie had the idol (facts unsure by Dreamz's double-sided dealings), Edgardo would be left unprotected and be voted off if the 5-member alliance held. This would also confirm whether Dreamz was trustworthy and cost the Four Horsemen use of the idol. At Tribal Council, Alex played the hidden Immunity Idol, but for naught as he received no votes, and the Earl-led alliance stuck to their plan and voted out Edgardo. Jeff noted the Hidden Immunity Idol would be re-hidden with new clues available on Exile Island."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US14","season":14,"episode_number_overall":197,"episode":11,"episode_title":"Blackmail or Betrayal","episode_label":"Ep 11","episode_date":"2007-04-26","episode_length":43,"viewers":13830000,"imdb_rating":7.2,"n_ratings":91,"episode_summary":"With Edgardo gone and Dreamz having defected, the \"Four Horsemen\" alliance collapsed.

The other teammates will attempt to catch the ball using a basket. Each time someone catches a ball they score a point for their team, regardless of which team's ball they catch. The first team to score five points wins. For the reward, a seaplane will take the winning team to a luxury spa resort where they will have a hot shower, dinner and a night in a bed.Boo struggled in the Reward Challenge when he injured his knee, but he popped it back into place and continued playing. Alex, Dreamz, Earl, and Stacy won the reward and sent Boo to Exile Island. At the spa, Alex scrambled to see if he could get any support from his fellow tribemates, but he could not. Alex and Mookie figured that Yau-Man had the other hidden Immunity Idol from the Moto camp and confirmed this when they searched through his personal belongings. They plotted to confront Yau-Man about the idol at Tribal Council to either get him to lie about having the idol or stir up trouble by casting doubt among his alliance. However, Cassandra and Stacy were nearby, attempting to eavesdrop on the conversation. Although they only heard small parts of the conversation and didn't learn exactly what their adversaries were planning, they were spotted by Mookie and Alex, who then decided to confront Yau-Man immediately. They attempted to blackmail Yau-Man into telling his alliance about the hidden Immunity Idol or they would tell them. Yau-Man decided to tell the members of his alliance, but the strongest reaction was anger that Alex and Mookie went through Yau-Man's personal bag. \n\nImmunity Challenge: Testing their memory, each Survivor will secretly select three squares on a grid, horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The goal is to knock out their opposing teammate by guessing squares and bombing them one by one. When all three squares belonging to a Survivor are knocked out, they'll be out of the challenge. The last person with squares still left on the board wins individual Immunity.At the Immunity Challenge, Stacy won immunity by taking out Yau-Man and Alex. Boo convinced his alliance that it would be better to split the votes between Alex and Mookie, just in case either of them had found the remaining idol, even though neither of them had any clues about the rehidden idol. At Tribal Council, it was admitted openly that Yau-Man had the hidden Immunity Idol and that Alex and Mookie were on the outside. The six-person alliance held to their plan of splitting their vote between Mookie and Alex, but Alex voted against Mookie to successfully avoid a tie.

Boo selected Earl to go back to Exile Island for a fourth time. In a surprise, the three castaways on the trip received letters from home. Alex noticed the others complaining about Boo being too talkative, so he approached Dreamz about convincing the others to vote Boo out before Alex. \n\nImmunity Challenge: Survivors will race to dig up three climbing steps buried randomly in the sand.

However, the energy expended by Alex and Dreamz was too much for them to overcome and Boo won individual immunity for the first time.

Calling on her professional wrestling skills, Ashley attempted to grapple with the heavier Jean-Robert. Jean-Robert dragged Ashley along behind him and took out Frosti, leaving James free and clear to score the winning point for Fei Long. The twist was that Fei Long was to kidnap a member of Zhan Hu who would stay with them until the next immunity challenge. Fei Long opted to kidnap Jaime as she was seen as a \"spot of sunshine\" and thought her being gone from Zhan Hu would be demoralizing. Probst gave Jaime a sealed bamboo tube with instructions to be opened in private once at the Fei Long camp. Jaime opened the sealed bamboo tube to reveal a second, smaller bamboo tube containing a clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol which must be given to a member of Fei Long without opening it before rejoining her tribe at the next immunity challenge. Jaime gave the sealed clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol at Fei Long to Leslie, seeing her as the weakest member of Fei Long.

After introducing themselves, the tribes were divided by schoolyard pick. As traditional in Gabon, Jeff announced that the oldest people usually make the decisions in the tribe and therefore the oldest castaways, Bob and Gillian, started the pick. After the tribes were picked, tribe names Fang and Kota were announced, and buffs passed out, Jeff announced the first challenge for individual Immunity Idols and extra food. \n\nTribal Reward/Individual Immunity Challenge: The tribes would have to race across the plain and up a hill. The first castaway from each tribe to the top of the hill would win an Individual Immunity Idol that would only be good at their tribe's first Tribal Council. The first entire tribe to the top of the hill would win an extra bag of corn and beans.Marcus and GC won individual Immunity Idols and Kota won the extra bag of food. At the Kota tribe, Bob and Ace took charge and organized the campsite. At the Fang tribe, a nighttime visit by an elephant spooked the tribe. Randy hit his head on the tribe's hut, requiring a visit by the Survivor medical team to put in several stitches. \n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: Six tribe members would be belted together and have to race through a swamp, over a net wall, and under and over a series of hitching posts. The six would then have to dig up three bags of puzzle pieces and deliver them to the three remaining tribe members. These three would then assemble the puzzle pieces to win flint and immunity.At a combined Reward/Immunity Challenge, Kota pulled far ahead while digging up the puzzle bags and won by a blowout. Before Tribal Council, Michelle and Gillian were targets for votes due to their negativity and age, respectively. Michelle's negativity outweighed concerns over age and she was voted out. After the vote, Jeff announced that Fang would be taking their torches back to camp and gave them a flint.\nPicked as the leader of Fang at Tribal Council, GC started the tribe's first fire and organized jobs to fix up the campsite. At Kota, Charlie and Marcus formed an alliance; the two expanded their alliance to include Jacquie and Corinne. The four discussed bringing in Bob to have a majority, though Bob would be kept out of the core alliance of four. In the early morning of day 5, GC resigned his leadership of the tribe after arguing with Gillian over waking up early and making too much noise. After receiving tree mail announcing the next challenge, Dan tried to unify Fang by painting everybody with charcoal face paint.\n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: The tribes have to roll a large ball through a series of gates. At two points along the course, a tribe member would have to climb atop the ball to retrieve of set of keys. At the final gate, the keys would unlock three chains that blocked the gate. The first tribe to go through all the gates and roll their boulder atop a short pedestal wins fishing gear and immunity.Despite Fang's attempts to boost morale, Kota won their third challenge in a row. Kota selected Dan to go to Exile Island, where he chose to get a clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol, but he was not able to decode the clue to find it. At Fang, Randy fashioned a fishing hook out of parts from his glasses and the tribe was finally able to get some meat. Gillian suggested to Susie that the two of them form an alliance, fearing they might have been next in line to be voted out since they were the oldest women in the game; she suggested the two vote off Ken because Gillian thought he was useless. Dan's behavior after he returned from Exile Island made the others suspicious that he had found the Hidden Immunity Idol. This caused some of the Fang tribe to reconsider voting out Gillian, and instead vote for Dan. At Tribal Council, Gillian's weakness at physical challenges was seen as a greater concern than Dan's potential of having the Hidden Immunity Idol and she was voted out."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US17","season":17,"episode_number_overall":230,"episode":2,"episode_title":"She Obviously is Post-Op!","episode_label":"Ep 2","episode_date":"2008-10-02","episode_length":44,"viewers":13080000,"imdb_rating":7.2,"n_ratings":215,"episode_summary":"At Fang, the argument over who was or was not the tribe leader continued.

Two members of the opposing tribe would attempt to remove the tribe member from the post and drag them across the sand to the finish line. The first tribe to get the member of the other tribe across the finish line would receive one point. The first tribe to score two points wins blankets, a hammock, pillows, and a mat.At the Reward Challenge, Ace chose Paloma to hang onto the post.  However, the Fang members easily overpowered her, leading to their first victory.  They also elected to send Sugar to Exile Island.  The win re-energized the Fang tribe and they finally felt like a team.  Meanwhile, at Kota, Paloma's poor effort at the challenge caused her to be seen as the weakest link in the tribe.  Corinne talked to Bob about joining her alliance of four, though she kept him in the dark about his status in the endgame. On Exile Island, Sugar elected to receive a clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol over comfort and followed the clues to find the Hidden Immunity Idol. Sugar then revealed that her father's recent death was the motivation for her playing the game. \n\nImmunity Challenge: One at a time, six tribe members would slide down a water slide. They would then swim out to retrieve a numbered tile, then run up the hill they slid down to drop their number off. Once all six tiles were retrieved, the remaining castaway would use the tiles to solve a numeric puzzle. The answer to the puzzle is a combination to open a locked chest which holds an ax. The first tribe to open their chest and use the ax to cut a rope that would raise their tribe's flag would win.During the Immunity Challenge, Ken secured Fang's victory by overcoming Kota's lead at the tile retrieval stage and solving the numeric puzzle before Bob.  After the Immunity Challenge and back at their camp, Sugar told Ace that she found the Hidden Immunity Idol while leading the others to believe she didn't have it.  Paloma approached Corinne about forming an alliance and targeting Ace for elimination, due to Ace being manipulative and trying to set her up for failure at the Reward Challenge.

In retaliation, he targeted her for the next elimination. Over at Fang, an alliance of Dan, Matty, Randy, and Susie formed and targeted GC for elimination. The remaining members of Fang, Crystal, GC, and Ken formed their own alliance. When the tribes next gathered, Jeff announced that the castaways would rank their tribemates by secret survey according to their importance within the tribe. Kota ranked Marcus as most important in their tribe followed by Ace, Bob, Charlie, Jacquie, Corinne, Sugar, and Kelly. Fang ranked Matty as most important in their tribe followed by Dan, Randy, Crystal, Ken, GC, and Susie. After announcing the rankings, Jeff told the castaways to drop their buffs as they would be picking new tribes by schoolyard pick once again. Voted as most important within their tribes, Marcus and Matty stayed with their original tribes and started the draft. The new Kota was Marcus, Dan, Charlie, Randy, Corinne, Susie, and Bob, while the new Fang tribe consisted of Matty, Ace, Crystal, Jacquie, Ken, Kelly, and GC. As Sugar was not selected during the process, she was sent to Exile Island. She would stay there until after the next Tribal Council and then join the tribe that lost the next Immunity Challenge. Since she had already found the Hidden Immunity Idol, Sugar chose the comfort option at Exile Island. At the newly formed Fang campsite, Crystal noticed that Kelly felt like an outcast at the old Kota and invited her to join her alliance with GC and Ken. \n\nImmunity Challenge: The tribes would play a lacrosse-like game on the water. Each tribe member would be on a raft and have a paddle. Each round, Probst would toss a ball into the water. The castaways would paddle around the playing field, using the paddle to pass the ball from one tribemate to another. The first tribe to throw the ball three times into their opponents goal would win.At the Immunity Challenge, Randy scored all three goals for Kota in their shutout victory over Fang. Kelly's poor performance at the challenge made Crystal, GC, and Ken reconsider their alliance with her, as they now perceived her as the weakest member of the tribe. However, they decided to target Jacquie instead, realizing that Sugar might have the Hidden Immunity Idol and with it, the trio of Ace, Sugar, and Jacquie would hold power within the tribe. They wanted to ensure that Ace in particular had as little power as possible, as he was also a physical threat. The three shared their plan with Matty to persuade him to vote their way, but he immediately informed Jacquie of the development. Jacquie tried to plead her case to Ken and Crystal, casting herself as an outsider who was not allied with Ace and really wanted to remain in the game.

An opposing tribe member would stand in front of the wall and use a club to try to knock away the fruit as it was thrown through the air. Once a piece of fruit is caught by a tribe member, it would have to be thrown through a hole in a second wall defended by a second opposing tribe member. The tribe that catches the most fruit by weight after five minutes would win an herb garden, salt, oil, chili sauce, and all fruit collected from the challenge.At the Reward Challenge, a strategy change of tossing two fruit at a time over Ace defending the second wall helped Kota win the challenge by 2 pounds (0.91 kg). Kota chose to send Sugar to Exile Island for the third time in a row, with Dan stating that it was a strategy move to force her to play the Hidden Immunity Idol before the tribal merge as they wanted it back into circulation. At Exile Island, Sugar once again opted for the comfort. At the Fang camp, the pressure of the game started to get to GC and he argued with Crystal. Immediately before they were to leave for the Immunity Challenge, he went off alone in the tribe's kayak, causing his tribemates to call out for him. He returned just before they left for the challenge. \n\nImmunity Challenge: One member from each tribe would roll a large ball made of interwoven sticks down a hill. A blindfolded tribe member at the bottom of the hill would attempt to block the opposing tribe's ball with a shield and the aid of a caller. Behind the blocker would be a row of seven goals of varying point values. If a tribe's ball made it past the blocker and into a goal, they would be awarded the specified number of points. The tribe with the most points after five rounds would win.At the Immunity Challenge, Fang was in the lead until the last round of the challenge when Randy, the caller for Kota, tricked Ace, the blocker for Fang, into stopping and allowing the last Kota ball to reach the goal. The final points were enough for Kota to win the challenge, continuing their winning streak. Before Tribal Council, GC told Matty that he was ready to leave the game.

Over at Kota, Dan's extra helpings of food caused conflict among the tribe while the dwindling food supplies at Fang made them rethink their rationing of food. After Ace told Sugar that he thought the rest of Fang went through her bag and discovered the Hidden Immunity Idol, she gave him the idol for safekeeping.\n\nReward Challenge: The tribes would be tethered to a 20-foot (6.1 m) long, 200-pound (91 kg) cloth snake. The tribes would start at opposite ends of an oval course. Both tribes would run counter-clockwise around the course and try to catch up to the other tribe.

Randy's taunting of an emotional Crystal did not sit well with her and she predicted that the old Fang and new Fang members would not get along. Kota chose to send Sugar back to Exile Island for the fourth time. Unlike her last visit where she enjoyed the food with the comfort, Sugar felt guilty about eating while her fellow tribe members subsisted on three scoops of rice. Kelly thought that Crystal crying after the Reward Challenge was a sign of weakness, but Crystal said that it was not. \n\nImmunity Challenge: The tribes would divide into three pairs. Each pair would be tethered together by a rope. The first pair would crawl under a cargo net, race through the jungle, go through an obstacle, retrieve two sections of a flag pole, and return to the starting line. The next pair would run the same course with an additional obstacle to retrieve the next two pieces of the flag pole. The final pair would run the course with two additional obstacles and retrieve the final two pieces of the flag pole. The first tribe to collect all of the flag pole pieces and assemble their flag would win.At the Immunity Challenge, good teamwork by Kota during the flag pole assembly versus Ace trying to assemble Fang's flag alone allowed Kota to extend their winning streak to five challenges in a row. After the challenge, Matty approached Ace about blindsiding Sugar to flush the Hidden Immunity Idol, but Ace convinced Matty not to worry about the Hidden Immunity Idol being played and to vote for Kelly, though Ace did not tell Matty that he had the idol. Crystal also wanted to blindside Sugar or vote out Ace, but Matty told her of Ace's plans. Ken talked to Matty about blindsiding Ace, but Matty told Ken that he made a promise that he could not break. Lastly, Ken talked to Sugar about Ace and she told Ken that she had given the idol to Ace. Ken was unable to convince Sugar to change her alliances, but Ken did make sure that Sugar took the idol back from Ace.

The twist was that Marcus had to assign Individual Immunity to one member of the other tribe and he selected Sugar.

At the feast, a clue for a second Hidden Immunity Idol was tucked under a locked box that the castaways would open after the feast was over. Ken noticed the note first, but when he tried to get the note for himself, Charlie saw the note and forced Ken to share the note with everybody. When nobody showed much interest in going to find the idol for fear of looking greedy, Marcus proposed to dig up the Hidden Immunity Idol, but to throw it in the ocean so that nobody could use it. Although many were tempted to take the Idol, the castaways finally agreed to throw it into the ocean. When the castaways opened the locked box, they were instructed to each draw a numbered stone from a bag. A second note was then read, stating that they had just selected new tribes. Castaways with odd numbers would be the new Fang and the even numbers the new Kota. At the new Kota, Marcus identified Crystal as the cousin of one of his friends, forming a connection with her. The two agreed not to write each other's names down at Tribal Council, but Crystal later stated in a confessional she had no intention to be loyal to him. Marcus tried to convince Susie to join his alliance with himself and Bob.

Not wanting to betray her long term alliance with Ken, Crystal told Ken what Marcus told her.

Randy told Matty that Matty had \"whored [himself] out\" to the original Kota alliance, at which point Matty rescinded his voting off order and gave into his alliance's want of voting Randy off. \n\nImmunity Challenge: In the first round, the castaways would race across a series of balance beams carrying a bag of puzzle blocks. The first two castaways to bring all three of their bags would go to the final round in which each player must stack all of their pieces like a line of domino tiles while avoiding ropes that would topple the tiles that were already stacked. Once all of the blocks were properly stacked, the castaway would start a chain reaction which would release a flag. The first castaway to raise their flag would win.At the Immunity Challenge, Corinne's sealed note that she bought at the Survivor Auction stated that she would skip the first round and go directly to the final round. Despite her advantage, Ken defeated her and Matty in the final round. After the Immunity Challenge, Bob told Sugar that he still did not have the Hidden Immunity Idol and she told him that he should give his fake idol to Randy. Figuring that he had nothing to lose and it would keep him in the game, Bob agreed to Sugar’s plan and gave Randy the fake idol. At Tribal Council, Randy pulled out the idol before the votes were read. Jeff announced that it was not a hidden immunity idol and tossed the idol into the fire pit. The votes against Randy were counted and he was sent to the jury."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US17","season":17,"episode_number_overall":238,"episode":10,"episode_title":"I Was Put on the Planet For This Show","episode_label":"Recap","episode_date":"2008-11-27","episode_length":43,"viewers":8310000,"imdb_rating":6.3,"n_ratings":116,"episode_summary":"A recap of the first 30 days including previously un-aired bonus footage."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US17","season":17,"episode_number_overall":239,"episode":11,"episode_title":"The Good Things in Life Aren’t Easy","episode_label":"Ep 11","episode_date":"2008-12-04","episode_length":44,"viewers":12730000,"imdb_rating":7.6,"n_ratings":206,"episode_summary":"Back at camp after Tribal Council, Bob was upset at all of the laughing when Randy was voted out. Corinne and Sugar argued over how to play the game. At the Reward Challenge, the castaways got to view a short video clip from their loved ones before the schoolyard pick. Jeff said that the castaways' loved ones were not around the corner and he only had the videos of them. Because \"today is all about love\" according to Jeff, nobody was sent to Exile Island. \n\nReward Challenge: The castaways would be split into two teams of three by schoolyard pick. The unpicked castaway would be ineligible to win the reward. The teams would be roped together and have to race through a swamp to collect seven sprocket pieces at two different stations. After collecting all the sprockets, the team would have to assemble them on a board in order to turn another sprocket which in turn would raise a flag. The members of the winning team would move on to the final round to individually solve a sliding puzzle. The first castaway to solve the puzzle would win a video from their loved one, pizza, beer, and brownies. Not announced at the challenge was an in-person visit from their loved one.The schoolyard pick resulted in one team of Susie, Matty, and Ken and another team of Crystal, Sugar, and Bob; Corinne was not picked, so she could not win. The team of Bob, Crystal, and Sugar came from behind to win the first round of the challenge and moved on to the final round. Bob won the Reward Challenge by quickly solving his sliding puzzle first. Jeff then told the rest of the tribe that he had nothing for them and told them to head back to camp. While Bob was watching the video clip from his wife, she paused and said that there was \"something I wanted to show you\" and moved off-camera. Contrary to what Jeff said at the start of the Reward Challenge, Peggy, Bob's wife, was in Gabon and she stepped around the corner to surprise Bob. Bob and Peggy then walked hand in hand to the Nobag campsite to meet the rest of the castaways. After introducing his wife to the tribe, Bob turned and whistled to signal the other castaways' loved ones to make an appearance. Matty proposed to his girlfriend, Jamie. The loved ones departed camp before sundown. Bob shared with Corinne a plan to blindside Matty where Bob would make up a second fake Immunity Idol and tell the Fang alliance that it was the idol that Marcus threw into the ocean. Bob's story was that Marcus only threw the bottle into the ocean, had hidden the idol around the camp, and told Bob where it was. \n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would be asked trivia questions about Gabon. For each question answered correctly, the castaway would earn one ball. After four questions are asked, the castaways would throw the balls that they won down a hill at a target divided into zones. The castaway who throws their ball into the zone closest to the center of the target would win.At the Immunity Challenge, Bob won by throwing his second ball one zone from the center. With Bob's win, Corinne expanded upon her blindsiding plan with Bob by concocting the story that Bob would have played the idol tossed into the ocean at the next Tribal Council, but since he won Individual Immunity, he would give Corinne the lost idol. Bob and Corinne hoped that the threat of Corinne having an idol would deter the Fang alliance from voting for her and would instead vote for Matty. Corinne told the story to Ken, which he believed and he suggested that Bob and Corinne approach Crystal with their plan. Bob told the story to Crystal and showed her the second fake idol. Crystal and Ken talked about their voting strategy under this plan where Ken would vote for Matty, Crystal would vote for Corinne, resulting in a 4-3 vote split between Corinne and Matty, respectively, Corinne would play the lost idol negating votes against her, the lost idol would be flushed, and Matty would be going home. At Tribal Council, the vote went as Crystal and Ken planned, Corinne's bluff was called and she was sent to the jury."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US17","season":17,"episode_number_overall":240,"episode":12,"episode_title":"The Good Guys Should Win in the End","episode_label":"Ep 12","episode_date":"2008-12-11","episode_length":44,"viewers":13050000,"imdb_rating":8.1,"n_ratings":220,"episode_summary":"After the castaways returned from Tribal Council, Matty was upset because Ken voted for him.

They would then return to the start and toss the ball into a net. The first castaway to retrieve all three balls and get them into the net would win an overnight helicopter trip to a gorilla sanctuary in Loango National Park, a meal, a shower, and a bed to sleep in.Bob won the Reward Challenge and chose to take Crystal and Ken along on the trip and to send Susie to Exile Island. While on the trip, Bob reiterated his promise to give the immunity necklace to Ken. Ken decided that he would only take it if he felt he was in danger of being voted out. On Exile Island, Susie selected the comfort choice because she knew that Sugar already had the Hidden Immunity Idol. Back at camp, Matty tried to get Sugar to give him the Hidden Immunity Idol. After returning from the reward trip, Crystal yelled at Matty for him questioning Crystal and Ken's loyalty to him. The yelling made Sugar change her opinion about Crystal and Ken. She told Matty that he would not be going home after the next Tribal Council and hatched a plan to take out Crystal and Ken. \n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would be blindfolded during the challenge. At the starting line would be a Gabonese mask. At the other end of a net obstacle would be a duplicate mask with some pieces removed. Three bags of puzzle pieces would need to be carried across the net obstacle one at a time. The puzzle pieces would then need to be assembled to replicate the mask at the start line. The first castaway to correctly replicate the mask would win.At the Immunity Challenge, Bob won immunity for the second time in a row, marking his fourth consecutive challenge win. Ken told Crystal, Matty, and Sugar that Bob would give him the immunity necklace if they all told Bob that they would be voting for Ken, so they should tell Bob that and then vote for Bob instead to blindside him. Sugar told Bob of Ken's plan, that she would not vote for him, and to vote for Crystal. At Tribal Council, Bob and Ken said that their agreement over the immunity necklace would be that Bob would give it to Ken if Bob felt that Ken was in danger of being voted out. Jeff stated that this Tribal Council would be the last Tribal Council where the Hidden Immunity Idol could be played. Sugar was openly wearing the Hidden Immunity Idol. Before the voting started, Jeff asked Bob if he was going to give up the Immunity necklace. Bob stated that he was not going to give up the necklace as he thought Ken was not going to go home. Before the votes were tallied, Sugar gave the Hidden Immunity Idol to Matty who then presented it to Jeff.

In three of the huts would be a bag of puzzle pieces. One puzzle bag at a time would need to be retrieved from the maze and dropped off at the finish platform. Once all three bags were retrieved, the first castaway to correctly assemble the puzzle (a replica of a Gabonese hut) would win.At the Immunity Challenge, Bob narrowly beat Sugar, winning immunity for the third straight time and the fifth consecutive challenge. At Tribal Council, Ken felt confident going into Tribal Council that he would not be voted out, but that confidence was misplaced as he was unanimously sent to the jury.\nBefore the start of the final Immunity Challenge, the Final Four took the traditional journey honoring the castaways voted out before them.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would be given 200 wooden tiles. The first castaway to use the tiles to build a house of cards 10 feet (3.0 m) tall would win. There is a time limit of 30 minutes for the challenge. If after 30 minutes, no castaway has built the house of cards to over 10 feet (3.0 m) tall, the castaway who builds the tallest house of cards at the end of the time limit would win.Susie broke Bob's challenge winning streak by having built the tallest house of cards after 30 minutes. Sugar thought about forcing a tie at the next Tribal Council due to her loyalty towards Bob for being a father figure. Bob went off into the trees to practice starting a fire, anticipating a fire making tiebreaker challenge. At Tribal Council, Sugar did force a 2–2 tie between Bob and Matty. The tiebreaker challenge was to create a fire large enough to burn through a rope, which Bob won after resuscitating his initial fire to burn through his rope before Matty managed to even get one started. As a result, Matty became the final member of the jury.\nThe final three spent their last day at camp eating the traditional feast and burning down one of the huts at the campsite. At the final Tribal Council, Charlie asked Sugar and Susie why they felt they should be voted at the \"top of the totem pole\" even though they were ranked the second lowest and lowest, respectively, among their tribes before the first tribal switch. He asked Bob if the \"intimate cuddling and spooning all night long\" was more enjoyable than he would liked to admit. Crystal asked no question of Susie, asked Bob to tell her something that Sugar didn't tell him to do, and asked Sugar why she voted her out. Ken asked Susie why she thought she deserved the million dollars and his vote, asked Sugar why she back stabbed him, and Bob about their deal over the immunity necklace. Corinne asked Susie if she would be willing to have her vocal cords removed if she were to win the million dollars. She asked Bob to show the nasty side of Bob and make her believe that he did not like Sugar. She took the opportunity to make a callous comment about Sugar’s deceased father, to which Sugar gave an obscene gesture. Marcus asked no questions of Susie, what Sugar would do to honor her deceased father if she were to win, and for Bob to give one example of a situation in which he was responsible for his decisions. Randy asked Susie to elaborate on the time that Susie said she felt sorry for him and Sugar and Bob if they considered the consequences of putting him on the jury when they gave him the fake Hidden Immunity Idol. Matty asked Susie to tell him why Bob and Sugar were less deserving that she was of the million dollars, Sugar to reveal something that she felt that she did was evil, and Bob why Sugar and Susie were more deserving of the million dollar prize than he was."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US17","season":17,"episode":14,"episode_title":"Reunion","episode_label":"Reunion","episode_date":"2008-12-14","episode_length":34,"viewers":11740000,"imdb_rating":7.1,"n_ratings":205,"episode_summary":"Months later, the votes were cast and the jury revealed Bob the Sole Survivor receiving four jury votes while Susie received the remaining three and Sugar received nothing.

The game started immediately with Jeff announcing that the tribes would have 60 seconds to gather as many supplies from the back of the truck as they could. Timbira took all of the water and bags of beans, leaving Jalapao with only some melons and a few other supplies. Jeff then announced that the tribe's campsites were about a 4-hour trek by foot away, that one person from each tribe \"would not be making the journey\" and a vote would take place immediately. Jalapao voted for Sandy and Timbira voted for Sierra. Sandy and Sierra thought they were being voted out the game, but Jeff announced that they would only not be making the trek to camp and instead would be flown to their campsites by helicopter. When Sandy and Sierra arrived at their respective campsites, they were given the option to start setting up camp or follow clues to a disposable Hidden Immunity Idol that can only be used during their tribe's first Tribal Council. Sandy opted to follow the clues but did not find the idol before her tribe arrived. Sierra opted to start setting up the camp in order to improve her impression with her tribe. Carolina was annoyed that Sandy didn't work on the campsite. Timbira's trek did not end until dark, by which time Sierra had built a shelter big enough to house the entire tribe. Despite her hard work, Coach’s view on Sierra did not change and he still wanted to vote her out first. On day 2, Sandy resumed her search for the Hidden Immunity Idol but was stumped by the second clue. \n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: Six members of each tribe would race across a series of sand hills and into a river to retrieve a raft with puzzle planks tied to it. When all six members of the tribe returned to shore with the raft, the puzzle planks could be untied and taken back to the start line. The two remaining tribe members would assemble the planks into a staircase. Once all of the tribe was at the top of the staircase, any two tribe members would work together to navigate a peg through a table maze, which would release the tribe's flag to win flint and immunity.At the Reward/Immunity Challenge, Sandy gave Jalapao a huge lead by building the staircase quickly. However, Brendan and Erinn quickly caught up and solved the table maze for a comeback victory for Timbira. Back at Jalapao's camp, Carolina's bossy personality rubbed some people the wrong way, while Sandy's effort at the challenge earned high praise from her tribemates. Still worried about being voted out, Sandy went searching for the Hidden Immunity Idol before Tribal Council but was again unsuccessful.

Sierra came up with the cover story that she and Brendan were building a fire pit for the tribe that night, which Debbie believed and relayed to the rest of the tribe. Candace and Coach argued over how to cook the afternoon meal on day 5. Back at Jalapao, Taj told her tribe that she was married to famed football player Eddie George. At the start of the rain-soaked Reward/Immunity Challenge, Jeff announced that someone from the losing tribe would go to Exile Island. He added that there was a clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol at Exile Island, and a twist would be revealed after the challenge. \n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: Three castaways from each tribe would face off against each other in a river to retrieve a ball and throw it into their tribe's net to score a point.

Jeff announced the twist was that Brendan could choose one person from the winning tribe to join him on Exile Island; he chose Taj. J.T. and Stephen put their newly acquired fishing gear to use but did not catch anything. On Exile Island, Brendan and Taj found two urns and each had to choose one. Brendan's urn contained two notes: the first note was a clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol which he could optionally share with Taj and the second note telling him that he could switch tribes if he wanted to. After some pestering by Taj, Brendan shared the clue with her and they realized that the clue hinted that there was a Hidden Immunity Idol back at each tribe's campsite. They agreed to work to get sent back to Exile Island together to collect more clues. At Timbira, Candace lobbied her tribemates to vote for Coach, but her negativity backfired on her and she became the target to vote out.

The remaining castaway would work as a caller to direct the paired tribemates through a maze. Each set of tribemates would have to locate a bucket in the maze, navigate the rest of the maze to a tower, fill the bucket with water from the tower, return to the beginning of the maze, and empty the bucket into a container which would raise a flag. Once the water container was filled enough to raise a flag, the process would have to be repeated again, this time filling the buckets with corn from a different tower.

Every few minutes, two members of the opposing tribe would select someone to carry an additional 20 pounds (9.1 kg) of weight. If the weight becomes too much for a castaway, they would drop the pole and be out of the challenge. The last castaway standing would win for their tribe.

Joe and Erinn thought that if they could find the two Hidden Immunity Idols, they could have a strong alliance together. To counter Joe figuring out Jalapao's Hidden Immunity Idol had already been found, Taj and Stephen crafted a fake idol and placed it in the statue at tree mail. After using the real idol as a model for the fake one she made, Taj tried to hide it her bag, but J.T. stumbled upon the idol after she walked off. Stephen tried to cover for Taj by telling J.T. that Taj had just discovered the idol moments earlier and had shown it to him.

After the challenge, Joe told his tribemates that Erinn kept the clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol to herself. Using an excuse that he wanted some water, he went to find the idol, not knowing that what he found was a fake. Joe told the tribe to vote out Taj. Stephen and J.T. tried to convince Joe to vote out Sydney but were unable to convince him to change his vote. Stephen and J.T. thought about the possibility of blindsiding Taj at Tribal Council since Stephen had the Hidden Immunity Idol.

Over at Jalapao, an infection on Joe's left leg appeared to have gotten worse. The tree mail on day 19 hinted at a Reward Challenge with a feast for the winner, but the tribes instead arrived at the challenge site to see a hut with a feast and note saying that they had merged. The castaways named their new tribe Forza, a transliteration of força (Portuguese: \"strength\"), and moved to the old Timbira campsite. Coach approached J.T. about forming an alliance, which suited J.T. as he was concerned about Jalapao going into the merge down 4 to 6. After cementing the alliance with J.T., Coach approached Tyson about forming a four-way alliance with J.T. and Stephen, targeting Brendan as the next to be voted out because Coach and Tyson did not trust him. Tyson talked to Stephen and Debbie about the potential alliance. Taj was concerned that Brendan wasn't holding up to his end of the secret Exile Island alliance, but Brendan wanted to keep it a secret and lie low until there were only seven or eight castaways left. Joe and Erinn went to get the Timbira Hidden Immunity Idol, but found nothing and figured out that either Brendan or Sierra had it. \n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would hang onto the top of a pole as long as they can. The last person left hanging without touching the ground would win. This was a rendition of a challenge used in Survivor: Vanuatu and Survivor: Cook Islands and was later used in Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains.At the Immunity Challenge, Tyson outlasted Debbie to win the first Individual Immunity. After the challenge, Jeff told Joe to stay around so that the Survivor Medical Team could look at his infected leg. The doctor diagnosed that infection was serious and could spread to Joe's bones or blood, which could lead to amputation of his leg or loss of his life. Stephen, Tyson, and Coach decided to blindside Brendan and negate him potentially playing his Hidden Immunity Idol by splitting the Tribal Council vote with four votes against Brendan and three votes against Sierra. However, all of the plotting would have to wait potentially three more days when Jeff arrived at camp to announce that Joe had been medically evacuated from the game by the decision of the Survivor Medical Team and there would be no Tribal Council."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US18","season":18,"episode_number_overall":250,"episode":9,"episode_title":"The Biggest Fraud in the Game","episode_label":"Ep 9","episode_date":"2009-04-16","episode_length":44,"viewers":11640000,"imdb_rating":8.2,"n_ratings":120,"episode_summary":"Coach continued to feel that he was in control of the game and he targeted Brendan for elimination next, followed by Sierra.  With Joe's departure, Erinn lost her only alliance member and thought about aligning herself with the former Jalapao members. \n\nReward Challenge: The castaways would be divided into teams of three: black, red, and white.  The teams would have a row of eight team-colored ceramic tiles on frames belonging to them.  Playing in rounds, one member from each team would throw a metal ball at the other two team's tiles to try to break them.  When all eight tiles of a team were broken, the team would be out of the challenge.  The last team with an intact tile would win a whitewater rafting trip down the Rio Novo and a picnic of sandwiches, chicken wings, brownies, watermelon, and potato chips.The Reward Challenge was a nail-biter when the challenge came down to two partially broken tiles for the black team of Brendan, Debbie, and J.T versus the white team of Erinn, Sierra, and Stephen.  A final toss by Brendan knocked out the final white tile and his team won the challenge. They selected Stephen to go alone to Exile Island, per the rules post tribal merger.  Unlike most rewards in past seasons, the winning team went on their trip the next day instead of immediately after the completion of the challenge. On their picnic, Brendan talked to J.T. about going all the way to the finals together.  The next day, Brendan talked to Sierra and Taj about a plan to keep J.T. in the game and to vote out Coach, Erinn, and Tyson.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would be attached to a rope which is thread through three of obstacles, for which the castaways would have to climb under, over, or around.  The first three castaways to finish would move on to the next round.  The next round's challenge would be the same, but with a single obstacle three levels high.  The first castaway to complete the obstacle would win. A rendition of this challenge would later appear in Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains.The Immunity Challenge was won by Tyson for the second time in a row. Coach and Tyson conspired to split the Tribal Council vote four votes for Brendan and three votes for Sierra to protect against Brendan using his Hidden Immunity Idol.  Brendan wanted to finally reveal the secret Exile Island alliance to blindside Coach. Stephen and J.T. thought about following the Exile Island alliance.  At Tribal Council, Brendan revealed that he has a Hidden Immunity Idol, but opted not to play it, thinking he was safe.

The next morning, Sierra continued to plead for her life in the game, but Tyson ridiculed her and said that she would not be able to change the vote and she would be voted out next. \n\nReward Challenge: The castaways would be divided into two teams of four.  Two members at a time from each team would race across a field to retrieve a large puzzle board.  Once the pair returns, the other two teammates would retrieve another board.  Four boards would need to be retrieved.  Once retrieved, the boards would have to be arranged in a line so that the large holes were aligned like a grille to reveal seven vowels.  The revealed vowels and seven consonants that would be given to the team would need to be arranged to solve a four-word phrase.  The first team to solve the phrase (YOU'VE WON A FEAST) would win a trip to a local village for a feast of local food and a demonstration of Capoeira.At the Reward Challenge, the red team of Debbie, Erinn, J.T., and Tyson prevailed over the black team of Coach, Sierra, Stephen, and Taj.  Stephen was chosen to go to Exile Island for the second time in a row because the red team did not want to give Sierra the opportunity to find a supposed new Hidden Immunity Idol since Brendan took his with him when he was voted out.  At Exile Island, Stephen found the seventh clue to the original Hidden Immunity Idol, meaning no replacement Idol was put into play. Sierra continued lobbying Coach to give her a second chance to remain in the game, but Coach refused her pleas. After describing the Immunity Challenge, Jeff offered anyone who felt comfortable enough in the game to sit out and eat pizza for the duration of the challenge; Coach, J.T., and Stephen chose to eat. \n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would play a version of shuffleboard.  Each castaway would be given three pucks which they would try to slide closest to the target marked with an X.  The castaway whose puck ends up closest to the target would win. This challenge was originally from Survivor: The Amazon and Survivor: Vanuatu, and a rendition of this challenge would later appear in Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains.Debbie won the challenge with the last slide of the game by knocking away Sierra's puck.  Back at camp, Erinn pointed out to Stephen and Taj that there was an opportunity to vote out Tyson, the biggest perceived threat at the Immunity Challenges. Stephen agreed that this might be their only chance to take him out, so he convinced J.T. to blindside Tyson.  J.T. was concerned about breaking up the \"warrior\" alliance he had with Coach and Tyson.

Debbie talked to Coach about reforming the Timbira alliance to regain control of the game. \n\nReward Challenge: Each of the castaways would fill out a questionnaire about the tribe in private, then the results would be tallied and the Challenge would begin.  The questions would be posed to the group and the castaways would guess whose name was written most often.  Each time a castaway guesses the correct answer, they would get one chop at a rope assigned to another castaway.  After three chops, the rope would be released, which would smash an idol, removing that castaway from the challenge.  The last castaway whose idol is not smashed would win a trip to a natural spring and a home cooked, traditional Brazilian feast made by a local family.The Reward Challenge was won by Stephen, who selected fellow ex-Jalapaos Taj and J.T. to join him.  Stephen selected Erinn to go to Exile Island because he felt that he had a strong alliance with J.T, Taj, and Erinn and that they needed one of their alliance members at Exile Island to find any Hidden Immunity Idol, but there was no new clue to a new Hidden Immunity Idol.  While on their reward, J.T., Stephen, and Taj discussed strategy for the next Tribal Council, either voting out Debbie or Sierra.  Coach and Debbie tried to strongarm Sierra into rejoining the former Timbira alliance, but when she hesitated, they angrily turned on her.  Coach felt a line had been drawn in the sand and approached J.T. about what his plans were for the final four.  Coach lied to J.T. that it was Sierra who brought up bringing back the old Timbira alliance.  Meanwhile, Sierra told Stephen that it was Coach and Debbie who brought up the Timbira alliance. The differing stories made J.T. and Stephen suspicious of all three of them. \n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would toss a grappling hook to retrieve three bags.  The first three castaways to retrieve all of their bags would move on to the final round.  In the final round, the three would compete in a labyrinth game.  The first to finish would win.At the Immunity Challenge, Coach, J.T., and Debbie moved on to the final round, which was won by Coach. In an effort to show that she was not lying about her version of the potential reforming of the former Timbira alliance, Sierra confronted Coach and Debbie about what exactly happened between the three of them in front of the whole tribe.  Coach said that Debbie wanted to talk about a former Timbira alliance, Sierra got into Debbie's face, Debbie started to cry, and then he said that he did not want a Timbira alliance. Stephen and J.T. believed that Sierra's confrontation brought into the open Coach’s half-truths and Debbie's scheming and they considered voting Debbie out, but also thought that voting Sierra out would cause less drama in the future for the tribe.  At Tribal Council, Coach and Sierra continued their confrontation about who said what regarding a Timbira alliance.

He talked to Debbie about targeting Erinn and Taj next, with Taj to go first.  On the morning of day 31, Debbie woke up feeling that she needed to move away from her alliance with Coach and told J.T. and Stephen that she wanted an alliance with them.  However, Stephen was worried that she was just playing the game instead of wanting a real alliance. \n\nSurvivor Auction: Instead of a Reward Challenge, a Survivor Auction was held. Each castaway is given US$500. Castaways may not share any money or the item(s). The castaways must bid for the items in $20 increments. The auction will end without notice. Items bought include food and drinks and a video from home.On the last item up for bid, Jeff presented a Samsung Instinct loaded with a video message from loved ones at home and announced that the usual Survivor Auction rules would be suspended and that the castaways could pool their money in order to get one of the castaways to win the item. Everybody gave their remaining money to Taj so that she could win the item uncontested. At the very end of the video message, Taj's husband, Eddie George, said that he would see them back at camp.  After pointing out the last line in the video, Jeff told Taj that only Eddie would be back at camp, but if Taj offered to go to Exile Island where Eddie would join her, the other castaways' loved ones would be at the campsite.  She immediately accepted the offer. Back at camp, the castaways were joined by Coach’s assistant, Debbie's husband, Erinn's father, J.T.'s younger sister, and Stephen's brother. After the loved ones had left, the game resumed on the morning of day 32 with Debbie continuing to push her allegiance to J.T. and Stephen, even so far as promising to give the final Individual Immunity to one of them should she win it and they make it to the final three. The three continued to be suspicious of her promises, and after J.T. and Stephen told Erinn of this offer, Erinn said that Debbie had to go next. Coach, still uninformed of the voting out of Debbie, pushed the idea of voting out Taj to prevent the Hidden Immunity Idol from being played. \n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would have to go through an obstacle course of digging underneath a log, crossing a balance beam, and under a rope crawl.  The castaways would then run across a field to where a spinning series of ten mathematical symbols would be displayed.  The castaways would have to memorize the sequence of symbols, run back to starting line through the obstacles, and use the symbols in the correct order to solve a math equation.  The first castaway to solve the math problem correctly would win immunity.At the Immunity Challenge, Stephen was way behind the others as he stumbled off the balance beam several times, so he tried to remember all ten symbols in one pass, while the others needed multiple trips to try to remember the symbols.  Stephen's memory technique did not fail him and he was able to come from behind to win Individual Immunity for the first time.

The pole would be used to hook a sandbag which they castaways would swing to knock over three targets.  When all three targets are knocked over, a flag would be raised. The first castaway to raise their flag would win an overnight trip to the Governor's Retreat where the castaway would have a bed to sleep in, take a shower, and eat at a traditional Brazilian churrasco.The Reward Challenge was won by J.T. by a wide margin. He selected Stephen to go with him on the trip, and Coach to go to Exile Island.  After he was selected to go to Exile Island, Coach said that he welcomed the opportunity to test himself and would take the \"monastic approach\" on Exile by spending the time meditating without food or water.  This did not sit well with Erinn, who suspected that Coach was seeking an excuse for his inability to light a fire and prepare his meals. She called him out for trying to take the \"martyr approach\" and use his time at Exile Island as an excuse for not winning the next Immunity Challenge. While Stephen and J.T. enjoyed their reward, Erinn admitted to Taj that she felt a little guilty about what she said to Coach after the Reward Challenge, and was worried that what she said could cause J.T. and Stephen to vote her out before Coach. Taj reassured her that this was not the case, that their alliance was still strong. Coach did exactly what he said he would do on Exile Island, except for drinking some water, and was mentally refocused on the game.  While on their reward, J.T. and Stephen talked about voting Erinn out before Coach because of what she said to Coach.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would brace themselves with their arms between two walls while standing barefoot on two-foot pegs.  Every 15 minutes, the castaways would move down to smaller foot pegs.  When the castaways reached the third set of foot pegs, they would try to remain on them as long as they could.  The last castaway to remain on their pegs would win. A rendition of this challenge later appeared in Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains.The Immunity Challenge was won by J.T. when he outlasted Coach, who collapsed from the challenge due to back spasms.  Coach declined to have the Survivor Medical Team look at him as he said he feared that he would be pulled from the game for medical reasons.  Erinn and Taj were suspicious that Coach was playing up the sympathy card and that he did not want a medical exam because he knew that it would reveal that he was not hurt.  J.T. and Stephen told Coach that their alliance was good and that Erinn was going to be voted out, but Stephen was not sure who he would vote for.  At Tribal Council, the confrontation between Coach and Erinn at the Reward Challenge was again discussed.  Just before the vote, Coach recited a poem, which visibly annoyed the jury members. Before reading the votes, Jeff stated that this is the last time the Hidden Immunity Idol could be played.

The puzzle pieces would then be assembled into a web-shaped puzzle.  The first castaway to finish their puzzle would win.At the Immunity Challenge, J.T. got a large lead during the puzzle piece bag retrieval stage, Erinn made a huge comeback from behind during the puzzle assembly stage, but J.T. managed to finish his puzzle just in front of Erinn to win immunity.  Erinn pleaded her case to J.T. and Stephen that Taj was a threat for winning jury votes.  The men agreed that they would take each other to the Final Two no matter what but were undecided on if Erinn or Taj would be a greater threat at the next Immunity Challenge and with the jury.  At Tribal Council, the men decided to break up the Jalapao alliance that existed since very early in the game with a vote against Taj and she was blindsided by a vote of 3–1.\nOn day 38, Erinn and Stephen told each other that they had to win the Immunity Challenge as neither stood a very good chance against J.T. with the jury.  J.T. gave his word to Stephen that he would take him to the Final Two and Stephen likewise gave his word.  The day's tree mail told the Final Three to take the traditional journey honoring the castaways voted out before heading to their final Immunity Challenge. \n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would drop a ball into a metal chute.  The ball would travel down a spiraling metal track and exit out of one of two points.  The castaway would have to catch the ball and drop the ball back into the chute at the top.  Every few minutes, an additional ball would be added to the track until eight balls were simultaneously going around the track.  A turnstile gate in the middle of the track would rotate, causing the balls to alternate exiting out of the two exits.  If a ball exits the track and is not caught, the castaway would be eliminated from the challenge. The last castaway remaining would win. To make the challenge more difficult, each castaway would have one hand tied behind their backs.At the Immunity Challenge, Erinn was out first with three balls simultaneously going.  With four balls circling the track, Stephen bobbled and dropped a ball, giving J.T. his third Immunity Challenge win in a row.  Back at camp, even though Stephen lost the challenge, he felt a great relief that he would not have to decide who he had to take to the Final Two.  Erinn told J.T. that Stephen told her that he would take her to the Final Two over J.T. to ensure himself a victory with the jury.  When J.T. asked him, Stephen denied that he would have taken Erinn to the Final Two.  At the final Tribal Council, J.T. decided to stick with his alliance and promise to Stephen, voted against Erinn, and she became the final member of the jury.\nJ.T. and Stephen enjoyed the traditional Final Two breakfast that they had planned to attend since the very beginning of the game.  At the final Tribal Council, Brendan focused on Stephen's opening statement that he had grown personally in the game, asking Stephen and J.T. if personal growth was relevant and important to winning the game.  Erinn asked Stephen about his changing alliances between the Jalapao Three, the Exile Island alliance, and the Warrior alliance.  She asked J.T. why Stephen was the best player in the game.  Debbie questioned J.T. about if her first impression of him of being an honest person was correct or if lying and deception was his M.O. She asked Stephen that if he had been the one wearing the Individual Immunity necklace at the last Tribal Council, would he have taken Erinn or J.T. to the Final Two.  Coach asked J.T. and Stephen for examples of honesty and integrity during later stages of the game and being the noble warrior.  Sierra had no question to ask of Stephen.  She asked J.T. what he meant by taking the strongest players to the end as she called Stephen one of the weakest players in the game. Tyson asked J.T. if and why Stephen was an asset to him in getting to the Final Two.  Tyson asked for a response from Stephen about J.T.'s answer to Tyson's question.  Taj asked J.T. why, if it was so hard for him to write down Coach’s name at Tribal Council, it seemed so effortless for him to write down her name and why he thought it would be easy to lie to her.  She asked Stephen why he felt it was so important to blindside her and if he felt that she was that big of a threat in the game."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US18","season":18,"episode":15,"episode_title":"Reunion","episode_label":"Reunion","episode_date":"2009-05-17","episode_length":34,"viewers":11590000,"imdb_rating":7.5,"n_ratings":112,"episode_summary":"Months later, the castaways return to discuss the season with host Jeff Probst.

The swimmer would hand the key to the designated strong person to unlock a chain around two bundles of heavy logs. The logs would have to be carried to the next station where a designated agile person would use the log bundles to climb on top of a balance beam. The agile person would need to pull a second key along a rope twisted around the balance beam while remaining on top of the balance beam. At the final stage, a designated smart person would use the second key to unlock a bag of puzzle pieces and use them to assemble a statue. The first tribe to assemble their statue would win flint.When Foa Foa won the challenge, Jeff tossed maps to both tribes and sent them on their way. At Foa Foa, Mick downplayed his role of leader to stay \"under the radar\", believing that the leader always has a huge target on his head.

Once a castaway gets control of a ball, they would pass the ball to three other tribe members standing on a platform who would attempt to throw the ball through the opposing tribe's basket at the other end of the arena. One point would be scored when a ball is made in the basket. After every point, the tribes would change who was in the arena and on the platform. The first tribe to score three points would win tribal Immunity and fishing gear.At the combined Reward and Immunity Challenge, after many dirty attacks during the game, Jeff stated that the next dirty attack would result in getting kicked out of the challenge. Moments later, Ben kicked Russell S. in his leg. Jeff called a time out and kicked Ben out of the challenge, resulting in Foa Foa being short one member. In the end, Galu triumphed over Foa Foa. When the challenge ended, Jeff announced a twist—the leader of the winning tribe would select one member of the tribe to accompany the losing tribe back to their camp and observe them through the next Tribal Council. When Russell S. selected Yasmin, Jeff gave her a note to be read in private. Jeff also asked Mike to stay so the Survivor Medical Team could examine him due to the hard hits he received. The Survivor Medical Team determined that he would be unable to continue and pulled him from the game. At Galu, Shambo went spearfishing with the tribe's new fishing gear; however, when she came back with no fish and a missing mouthpiece to the swim mask, Laura felt that Shambo had \"signed her own death warrant\".

Between the beach and crates would be a \"battle zone\" marked off by four flags. Within this zone, an opposing tribe member would try to prevent the two castaways from crossing the zone and reaching the crate. Once the two castaways crossed the zone, they would bring a crate back to the beach, and a second pair of castaways would go out to retrieve another crate. Once all four crates were retrieved, the crates would need to be stacked so that one color didn't show more than once on each column. The first tribe to complete the puzzle would win comfort items of pillows, candles, mats, beach towels, and a hammock.At the combined Reward and Immunity Challenge, Galu never lost their lead and won their third consecutive challenge. After the challenge was over, Jeff gave Russell S., Galu's leader, an option of trading the reward of comfort items for more functional items such as fishing gear, a pot, a lantern, and a tarp. Believing it would be delightful to the Galu women, Russell S. chose the comfort items. Many of the tribe's men disagreed with his choice. When Russell S. was also given the decision on whom to send as the observer to Foa Foa, he chose Shambo. Her visit with Foa Foa went great, and she began to feel more comfortable with them than Galu. When discussions arose about whom to vote out, Liz and Russell H., as well as Ben, gunned for Ashley, but Mick was unsure if he would agree with them or vote for Ben. Russell H. made an agreement with Mick that as long as the latter would not vote for him, Ben would be the next gone after Ashley. In an attempt to gain Mick's trust, Russell H. showed the Hidden Immunity Idol to him. At Tribal Council, Ben and Jaison voiced their disagreement about whether Ben's statements were racist. The tribe decided to vote against Ben, and he was unanimously voted out."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US19","season":19,"episode_number_overall":259,"episode":4,"episode_title":"Hungry for a Win","episode_label":"Ep 4","episode_date":"2009-10-08","episode_length":43,"viewers":11690000,"imdb_rating":7.1,"n_ratings":101,"episode_summary":"The day's tree mail instructed the tribe leaders to select two castaways to join them at the upcoming Reward Challenge; Russell S. chose Dave and Shambo, while Mick chose Natalie and Russell H. While his tribemates were not around, Erik began a search for the Hidden Immunity Idol at Galu and succeeded. Meanwhile, at Foa Foa's campsite, Russell H. pondered about changing his \"final two alliance\" from Jaison to Natalie, believing that he could tell the jury Natalie rode his coattails; Natalie, on the other and, felt confident that she would beat Russell H. in a final vote and privately stated that she would continue to play to her strengths, laying low and forming personal relationships. Upon arriving at the challenge site, the six selected castaways realized Jeff was nowhere to be seen. After some hesitation, the six made a scramble towards a treasure chest and a cage of chickens. In the treasure chest, they discovered instructions that they were to do the challenge on their own. \n\nReward Challenge: Three castaways from each tribe would play a game similar to bocce. A flag would be placed in the center of a circle. The castaways would take turns tossing three balls each at the flag. The tribe who throws a ball closest to the flag would win three chickens.Dave won the challenge with a last ricochet shot. When the victorious Galu trio returned to Galu with the reward, Shambo was assigned to watch over the chickens, but she mistakenly let one loose.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would race across a net run carrying wooden blocks to a platform. When all of the blocks were at the platform, they would need to be stacked into a tower. The castaways would then cross a rope bridge to a second platform where two nets would be tied together holding more wooden blocks. After the nets were untied, the blocks would have to be stacked into another tower. The first tribe to stack both towers would win.When Foa Foa broke Galu's Immunity Challenge win streak, deliberations began about how Tribal Council would go down. Brett and Kelly were both upset at Yasmin for doing nothing around camp, while Shambo and Yasmin wanted to vote out Monica because of her performance in the challenge. When Russell S. was told that the rest of the tribe was leaning towards voting out Yasmin, he was upset that the tribe was not following his lead.

The castaway would score one point if they were able to drink the whole glass. The challenge would not be a race and there was no time limit on getting the food item down. The first tribe to score five points would win steaks, sausages, and onions.At the Reward Challenge, the chance for Foa Foa to win rested on Ashley's shoulders. After much taunting from the Galu bench, she quit the challenge and lost for her tribe. Per the rules, Galu's leader, Russell S., chose Shambo as the observer for the second time, a decision which infuriated her; he selected Shambo because he felt she had to pay for the loss of the chicken. Upon reaching the opposing tribe's camp, Shambo shared all of the clues to the Hidden Immunity Idol with the Foa Foa members. Liz presumed Russell H. to have the Hidden Immunity Idol, however, and confronted him about it. He denied he had it and then threatened Liz for confronting him.\n\nImmunity Challenge: One man and one woman from each tribe would hold on to a rope that would suspend a net. The castaways from the other tribe would attempt to toss coconuts into the net which would weigh it down, making it more difficult to hold onto the rope. Should the net touch the ground, the castaway would be eliminated from the challenge. The castaway who held on to the rope the longest without letting the net touch the ground would win for their tribe.At the Immunity Challenge, Russell H. was the first to drop his net, and Liz dropped her net shortly afterward, losing the challenge for Foa Foa. Back at camp, rain had been pouring down for more than a day, and the Foa Foa members were forced to huddle together. Russell H. originally wanted Liz out because she had confronted him, but had second thoughts after seeing her strength in the Immunity Challenge. He also knew that Ashley was clearly the weakest link in the tribe. Foa Foa was unable to strategize, however, as the rain kept them together in the shelter. At Tribal Council, Liz's challenge strength helped her, and Ashley was unanimously voted out to maintain a strong tribe."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US19","season":19,"episode_number_overall":261,"episode":6,"episode_title":"This Is the Man Test","episode_label":"Ep 6","episode_date":"2009-10-22","episode_length":43,"viewers":12880000,"imdb_rating":7.7,"n_ratings":102,"episode_summary":"The rain continued for the fifth straight day, but ended soon thereafter.

At the end of the maze would be a labyrinth-like table maze. The castaway inside the cage would then have to guide four blindfolded castaways in solving the table maze. The first tribe to finish the table maze would win pizza while observing the losing tribe at Tribal Council.At the Reward Challenge, Jeff announced that both tribes would be going to Tribal Council that night to vote somebody out of the game. Foa Foa selected Liz to be the guide with Jaison and Russell H. as cage-rollers, while Galu selected Laura to be the guide with Erik and Russell S. as cage-rollers. Towards the end of the cage-rolling stage, with Foa Foa in the lead, Russell S. became disoriented and struggled to make it to the puzzle table. When he collapsed at his station onto the puzzle table, Jeff called for a halt so the Survivor Medical Team could tend to Russell S. After examination, they found that he had dangerously low blood pressure which was even worse than Mike's injury was. Jeff officially called off the challenge and stated that although neither tribe would win the reward, both would still go to Tribal Council and vote somebody off. Moments later, as the medical team tried to sit him up, Russell S. blacked out again with his eyes open. The medical team tried to ask him if he remembered what just happened and told Jeff that Russell S.'s heart rate went from 97 (when they set him up) to 68. The medical team eventually decided it was time for him to be pulled from the game. Russell S. protested at first; saying his family depended on this and that he was just a little dehydrated. However Jeff said that after what he saw happen in front of him; including blacking out two times in front of him there would be no way Russell S. would stay in the game and that if he didn't get any help he would get worse. Feeling his frustration, Jeff reminded Russell S. that he was in great shape and had led a tribe that dominated, that there had been no sign earlier of him going home and he pushed himself until the end. Back at Foa Foa, the vote was between Natalie and Liz, while at Galu, the women targeted Shambo for being an outsider, while the men targeted Monica for being a liability in challenges. At Tribal Council, when the two tribes arrived at the site, Jeff explained Russell's condition, how he was removed from the game, and what had happened to Russell S. after the two tribes had been sent back to their respective camps. Jeff made a final announcement that due to the unprecedented circumstances of the incomplete challenge, including how big of an impact that Russell S. had on the Galu tribe, there would be no vote and nobody else would be going home.

One tribe member at a time would uncover two items. If the items matched, they would score one point for their tribe. However, the tribe leaders would have the option of forfeiting the point and taking the uncovered pair. The tribe with the most points at the end of the challenge would win a sailing trip aboard a three-masted barque and lunch, and the items collected for the points forfeited for either tribe.At the Reward Challenge, Brett, who was designated to make decisions on which items to keep, forfeited the first point to keep the then-uncovered fire starting kit. The remaining matched pairs were kept for points, and Galu easily won the challenge. Shambo chose Laura to miss the reward and observe Foa Foa, much to the anger of the latter.

This surprised the rest of the tribe, as Natalie had provided a good breakfast for all, and Jaison commented on how proud he was of her growth throughout the game thus far.\n\nReward Challenge: The tribe would split into two teams of five, with one castaway sitting out the challenge. Two castaways at a time, the teams would race out into a field to collect a series of poles with black and white colored coconuts.

The rope would be tied to one end of a heavy log. The other end of the log would be connected to a pivot point on a platform that the castaways would stand on. The castaways would start at the knot closest to the end of the log. Every three minutes, they would change hands and move one knot further down the rope.

This was partially brought up when Brett and Natalie joined hands as \"prayer warriors\" to help them through the challenge. After Jaison, Russell H., and Shambo won the challenge, they went on their reward trip. Jaison told Russell H he agreed to go to the top three together.

Russell H. told Shambo, suspicious that Jaison was hiding something, that Jaison was upset, that he wanted to vote out Mick, and that Russell H. agreed with the vote.

Once back with the bag, they would climb up a steep wall to a platform where they would assemble the puzzle pieces. The first castaway to assemble their puzzle, the Survivor: Samoa logo, would win.Russell H. was again extremely confident going into the Immunity Challenge, but while he had an early lead, Brett came from behind during the puzzle assembly stage and pulled off his third immunity win in a row. Natalie and Russell H. again discussed what the plans were for Tribal Council. Russell H. wanted to keep Natalie around, as he felt that she would be seen by the jury members as \"riding his coattails\" and therefore not get any votes. Russell H. told Jaison that they had to keep Natalie and get rid of Mick to make it to the final three, which Jaison agreed with.  Russell H. told Mick a different story: Jaison could not beat Brett in anything, and voting off Jaison would give them a better chance at beating Brett. Mick agreed with the plan, believing that Jaison wasn't mentally in the game while Natalie was. With the vote split—Jaison and Mick agreeing to vote for each other—the power of who went home fell to Natalie and Russell H. They decided to vote against Jaison, and he was sent home blindsided by a vote of 4–1.\nUpon returning to camp, Brett knew that he had to win the next Immunity Challenge or he would be going home. Russell H. made a deal with Brett that should either of them win the next Immunity Challenge, that they would take each other to the final three. The final four took the traditional journey honoring the castaways voted out before heading to their Final Immunity Challenge.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would balance a wooden statue on top of a pole which they would have to keep upright holding the bottom of the pole. At regular intervals, an additional 1-foot (30-cm) section would be added to the end of the pole, making the pole longer and harder to balance. The last castaway still holding the statue up would win.The challenge came down to Brett and Russell H.; with the poles at 7 feet (2.1 m) long, Brett lost the balance on his pole and Russell H. won his first Individual Immunity.\nBrett figured that his only hope to remain in the game was the deal he made with Russell H.  Russell H. gloated about his challenge win to Mick and Natalie and said that he thought he had a great shot at the million dollars and was already rehearsing his jury speech.  Mick was concerned that Russell H. had some secret plan and that Mick was going home, but Natalie reassured him that the former Foa Foa would stick together.  Russell H. told Brett that he had a problem because he had made a deal with everybody to take them to the final three.  Russell H. told Brett that Brett was the kind of guy that Russell H. wanted his kids to marry and he wished he was like Brett when he was young.  Russell H. told Brett that Mick and Natalie would be voting against him and asked if Brett could win a fire starting challenge if Russell H. joined Brett in voting for Mick, forcing a tie. At Tribal Council, Mick and Natalie stated that there was no doubt in their mind that Brett was going home.  Jeff asked Russell H. if he could appreciate the competitor in Brett.  Russell H. answered that he respected the game and that Brett deserved to be in the final three.  Mick and Natalie emphasized that strategically, Russell H. had to vote out Brett.  In the end, Russell H. voted against Brett and he became the final jury member by a vote of 3–1.\nWith only three Foa Foa members left, Mick, Natalie, and Russell H. celebrated with the traditional Day 39 breakfast. Russell H. pressed Natalie over what she was going to say to the jury and he continued to gloat over how he had locked up the necessary jury votes. He even threatened to \"put her in the jury\", even though the jury stage of the game was over. The three then burned their encampment.  At the final Tribal Council, the final three made their opening statements.  Mick stated that he tried to play the game without overstepping his morals by trying not promise too much, overtly stomp on, lie, and mislead people, or treat them as pawns in the game.  Natalie focused on how she came into the game wanting to gain the confidence in going outside her comfort zone and that she appreciated everybody on the jury. Russell H. went over many of his big strategic moves throughout the game and claimed he played the game better than Mick or Natalie.\nThe time then came for the jury to ask their questions to the final three.  Jaison was up first, asking the three to tell the members of the jury who they really were and if they didn't, that he would.  All three told the jury what they did, but Jaison pointed out that both Natalie and Russell H. had made a lot of money before coming on Survivor, that Mick had the potential to make a lot of money, and that the jury should not focus who was broke, but on other criteria. Shambo took the opportunity to apologize to America for dismantling Galu and that she questioned that judgment call. She called Mick's overall game play \"feckless\", a word of which Mick did not know the meaning. She used the word \"coattail\" to describe Natalie, to which Natalie defended that she purposefully tried not to be aggressive in the game. Shambo then said that there was no way that Mick and Natalie would get her vote and said nothing to Russell H.  Brett asked nothing of Natalie or Russell H., but asked Mick what a \"bro date\" would be like with him to see to what level Mick invested in Brett as a human being. Kelly started with Natalie, telling her that she thought she was never on the field in the game and that Kelly always saw Natalie asking for help in the challenges, to which Natalie said that while she might not have been good in the challenges, but she gave 100% and that she got better as the game progressed.  She asked Russell H. if he lied, cheated, and stole in real life as he did in the game, to which Russell H. said that he did not and that \"honor, integrity, and loyalty\" was the most important thing to him, which she had a hard time believing. She said nothing to Mick.\nNext up was Monica, who asked Mick and Natalie why they felt the other two sitting beside them did not deserve to win.  Mick said that Natalie rode out her alignment with Russell H. throughout the game and that Russell H. was willing to lie, pit people against each other, mislead, and had a giant ego. Russell H. interrupted Mick's answer by stating that both Natalie and Mick didn't mind when Russell H. was being a snake and was congratulating him all the way. Monica appeared amused, said that she had heard enough, and sat down. Dave asked the three what they thought their chances were with the jury.  Mick thought it was 20–25%, Natalie 30–40%, and Russell H. said that his chances were a lot higher prior to Final Tribal Council but were now 55%.  Laura asked nothing of Natalie or Mick but asked Russell H. what he learned about her that enabled him to beat her, to which he generically stated that she was a threat. John asked nothing of Russell H. but asked Mick and Natalie for the \"hard sell\" of his vote. Mick repeated the theme of his opening statement that he was a stand-up guy, while Natalie said that she saw how the aggressive women in the game were getting voted out and that she adapted her game after that.\nErik asked no questions of the final three and instead made statements to the three.  He told Mick that he did nothing to deserve the title of being the tribe leader of Foa Foa. He told Russell H. that he played an unethical game and wondered if Russell H. got to the right place by behaving the wrong way and if Russell H. was proud of behaving in such a manner. Finally, Erik told Natalie that people would call her weak and undeserving, but asked why those characteristics were any less admirable than lying, cheating, and stealing. He went on to say that maybe she would call herself the less deserving of the title Sole Survivor, but that in an environment filled with \"arrogance\" (pointing to Russell H.) and \"delusional entitlement\" (pointing to Mick), that the person who might think she is the least deserving, could probably be the most. Erik closed his speech by saying that Natalie had his vote and hoped she would get four more."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US19","season":19,"episode":16,"episode_title":"Reunion","episode_label":"Reunion","episode_date":"2009-12-20","episode_length":33,"viewers":11680000,"imdb_rating":6.5,"n_ratings":103,"episode_summary":"Months later, the game was revealed that Natalie became the Sole Survivor over Russell H. and Mick by a vote of 7–2–0.

After explaining the challenge, Jeff stated that there would be a twist at the end. \n\nImmunity challenge: The castaways would stand on a perch, one arm above their head with their wrist tethered to a bucket of water on top of a platform. The castaway who could stand there the longest without tipping the bucket would win. During the challenge, Jeff would tempt the castaways to quit with offerings of cookies and milk; donuts and iced coffee; peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, chips, candy, and milk. When It Rains, It Pours challenge from Africa, All-Stars and Micronesia.Just as she had done when she last played this challenge during Survivor: Micronesia, Parvati outlasted everybody to win Individual Immunity.  The twist was that Jeff read a clue to a Hidden Immunity Idol to the entire tribe.  When the castaways returned to camp, everybody went looking for the Hidden Immunity Idol.  Sandra found it and hid it from the others.  Rupert stuck a rock in his pocket to feign finding the idol.  Russell fell for the deception and his alliance plotted a way to get Rupert to play the idol by splitting the vote at the next Tribal Council.  Colby and Rupert knew that the Villains alliance would split their vote between Rupert, Colby or Candice, so they agreed to vote for Candice, hoping the Villains would pick her for the split.  At Tribal Council, the Villains ultimately chose Candice and split their votes between her and Rupert. According to plan, Rupert and Colby voted for Candice, sending her to the jury.\nWhen the tribe returned to camp, Russell criticized the girls in his alliance that they should have split their votes between Colby and Rupert instead of focusing on Candice.  \n\nImmunity challenge: In the first round, the castaways would dig up a wooden peg and then guide the peg through a table maze. The first five to finish would move on to the next round. In the second round, the castaways would use four pegs to climb a wall.  The first three to reach the top of the wall would move to the final round. The final round would be a sliding puzzle. The first castaway to finish their puzzle would win. Wall to Wall challenge from Panama.At the Immunity Challenge, Rupert, Sandra, Russell, Parvati, and Danielle moved on from the first round. Russell, Parvati, and Rupert moved on to the final round. Russell finished his puzzle first to win Individual Immunity.  Parvati wanted to vote out Rupert.  Russell was concerned that Parvati was more loyal to Danielle than Parvati was to Russell, so he decided to break them up by discussing voting out Parvati with Danielle and telling Parvati that Danielle wanted to vote her out when it came down to five or six remaining.  Danielle and Parvati discussed Russell's stories to them and they figured out that Russell was trying to break them up.  The two begged Jerri to vote for Rupert to foil Russell's plan.  Meanwhile, Russell decided to get Danielle out of the game so that Parvati would stay loyal to him by telling Colby and Rupert that Danielle needed to go out next.  Russell threatened Jerri to vote out Danielle by telling Jerri she would be voted out next if Danielle didn't go.  At Tribal Council, Danielle and Russell argued over what the other had said to each other. Danielle broke into tears and unintentionally revealed that Jerri was not included in the Final 3 alliance of herself, Parvati and Russell. Russell's plan came together when Jerri switched her vote and Danielle was sent to the jury, becoming the first villain voted out since the merge."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US20","season":20,"episode_number_overall":283,"episode":13,"episode_title":"Loose Lips Sink Ships","episode_label":"Ep 13","episode_date":"2010-05-13","episode_length":43,"viewers":13280000,"imdb_rating":8.1,"n_ratings":120,"episode_summary":"The tree mail on day 34 was a Sprint Palm Pre loaded with videos from family members (Parvati's dad, Mike; Jerri's sister, Jennifer; Russell's wife, Melanie; Colby's brother, Reed; Rupert's wife, Laura; and Sandra's uncle, Fernando) announcing that they had arrived on the island and were looking forward to reuniting with the castaways at the next challenge.  \n\nReward challenge: The castaways would use a bucket to scoop water from the ocean and then toss the water to their loved one who would use another bucket to catch the water.  The loved one would then pour the water into a bucket hanging from a see saw.  The first pair to fill their bucket with enough water to tip their see saw would win a plane trip with their loved one to see the Alofaaga Blowholes along with a meal of hamburgers, soft drinks, cookies, and donuts. Pass the Bucket challenge from Cook Islands.After emotional introductions to the castaway's loved ones, the challenge was won by the team of Jerri and her sister Jennifer.  After winning the challenge, Jeff told Jerri that she could pick another castaway and their loved one to go along with them.  Jerri chose Parvati and her father Mike.  Jerri then asked Jeff if she could take one more pair.  Jeff agreed and Jerri picked Sandra and her uncle.  Russell was angry that Jerri did not pick him and his wife to join them on the trip.  During the trip, Jerri voiced concern that Russell would seek revenge on her for not selecting him for the trip.  Parvati and Sandra said they would protect her from any retaliation and that Russell had to vote out either Colby or Rupert in order to stay in the game.  Back at camp, Russell was indeed plotting to seek revenge by making an agreement with Colby and Rupert to go to the final three with them.  Russell thought he could swing Jerri over to this new alliance and vote out Parvati if she did not win the next Immunity Challenge. During the night of day 35 after the three women returned from their reward, Rupert angered Jerri by making a racket while the rest of the tribe was trying to sleep and she wanted to vote him out next.\n\nImmunity challenge: The castaways would hold two poles on the tops of their hands up against a board over their heads. Any movement in their hands would cause the poles to drop to the ground. If the castaway drops their poles, they would be eliminated from the challenge. The last person who does not drop their poles would win immunity. Keep It Up challenge from Gabon.Russell's new alliance's plan was spoiled when Parvati won the Immunity Challenge.  With his plan spoiled, Russell decided he had to flip back to his original girls alliance and vote out Rupert.  Sandra told Rupert that she wanted to vote out Russell.  Rupert told this to Russell, and Russell then confronted Sandra in front of Parvati asking if she was with him or against him.  Sandra replied that she was against him and then yelled out to Rupert about revealing her plan to Russell.  Russell scolded Parvati and Sandra about being dumb when they made fun of him and changed his mind yet again to vote out Sandra.  At Tribal Council, the argument between Russell and Sandra was discussed. Before reading the votes, Jeff stated that this is the last time the Hidden Immunity Idol could be played. Though Sandra thought she was safe going in and wouldn't need to play her Hidden Immunity Idol, she decided to play it since she had mixed feelings after the discussion.

Offer It Up challenge from China.Parvati won the Immunity Challenge by outlasting Colby.  After returning from the challenge, Colby gave his \"surrender speech\" to the Villains and told them they should just enjoy the day and he would not scramble to stay in the game.

Blind Maze challenge from The Amazon.Russell won the final Immunity Challenge by edging out Parvati and Jerri by mere inches.  After the challenge, Russell told Sandra that he was going to take her to the final three as he thought he could beat her at the final vote as she would get maybe only one vote.  Parvati disagreed and told Russell that getting rid of Sandra would be best as she would get votes from the jury.  At Tribal Council, Jerri was eliminated and became the final member of the jury.\nParvati, Russell, and Sandra celebrated with the traditional Day 39 breakfast. Unknowingly paying homage to something Russell once did, Sandra tossed Russell's hat into the camp fire in an attempt to throw him off his game at Tribal Council. The three burned down the camp and set off for the final Tribal Council. At the final Tribal Council, the jury questioned and lectured the final three on their strategic plays, their perceptions among the jury, what they would have done differently during the game, their loyalties, and how they played the game. The members of the jury made their dislike of Russell and his unlikelihood of receiving votes very clear; the other two finalists used this in their attempts to sway the jury.

When the castaways reassembled in front of Jeff, he announced that the groups they arrived in are not the tribes, but instead the tribes would be split by age, with the 40 and over castaways called Espada and the 30 and under castaways called La Flor. La Flor then traded the Medallion of Power to Espada in exchange for flint and fishing gear.  Once at the Espada camp, Jane started a fire with a pair of reading glasses.  At the La Flor campsite, Kelly B. showed her tribe her amputated leg, which made several of her tribemates cautious about a sympathy vote for her should she make it to the final Tribal Council.

Holly was conflicted due to her pact with Wendy Jo. At Tribal Council, Wendy Jo made a short speech just before the vote in an effort to remain in the game.

Over at Espada, Holly snapped at Jill for eating snails which Holly thought were inedible.  Holly dumped the snails, which caused the rest of her tribe to question what had gone wrong with her.  Holly overheard Dan calling her \"crazy\" and decided to take revenge on him by dumping his $1,600 pair of alligator-skin shoes into the ocean.

The alliance of Brenda, Chase, Jane, and Sash decided to protect NaOnka by distancing themselves from her.

Along the way of the course would be three stations where a key is suspended in the air on a metal spring.  The team would have to work together to reach the key and free it from the spring.  The first team to collect all three keys and unlock their team's flag would win a tour of the jungle canopy with zip-lining and a barbecue feast.At the Reward Challenge, the random draw for teams turned out to be men versus women. Since there were eleven castaways, Chase was the odd man out and did not participate.  However, he could select the team he thought would win, and if they won, he would join them on the reward.  He selected the women, but this turned out to be a poor choice when the men won the challenge.  On the reward, Marty continued his lobbying for his plan to vote out Jane.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would test their memory by having to memorize a series of symbols shown by Jeff.  The castaways would have to show back the symbols in order.  If they showed the wrong symbol, they would be out of the challenge.  The last castaway to show all of the correct symbols would win.The Immunity Challenge was won by Brenda.  Back at camp, Marty put his plan into motion by telling Chase that the men were voting for NaOnka.  Chase told Holly that he thought the guys were trying to blindside Jane and he was voting for Marty.  Marty told Brenda that the plan to flush the idol and blindside Jane was Sash's idea.  Brenda and Sash talked over their swing votes by either joining the Marty or Jane blocs.  At Tribal Council, the discussion became heated when NaOnka made an expletive-filled rant towards Marty and Fabio, culminating with NaOnka giving Marty the finger.  Marty's plan to flush the idol failed when NaOnka did not feel threatened enough to play her idol.  When the time to vote came, Brenda and Sash decided to join the bloc voting against Marty and he was sent to the jury."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US21","season":21,"episode_number_overall":294,"episode":10,"episode_title":"Stuck in the Middle","episode_label":"Ep 10","episode_date":"2010-11-17","episode_length":44,"viewers":11980000,"imdb_rating":7,"n_ratings":80,"episode_summary":"After Brenda and Sash tipped their alliances at the last Tribal Council, Holly decided that she had to make a move in the game and get either Brenda or Sash voted out next. She then recruited Jane, Benry, and NaOnka into voting for Brenda.  She talked to Chase about voting for Brenda, but he was more concerned about Benry being a bigger threat. Holly left Kelly S. out of the plan believing that she wouldn't switch because she was riding Brenda's coattail. A rain storm came and the tribe moved their three wooden chests around the fire in order to protect it before they headed off to the challenge.\n\nReward Challenge: The tribe would be split into two teams by school yard pick.  The teams would be given four barrels, two wood planks, and 10 feet (3.0 m) of rope that they would use to cross the beach without stepping on the sand.  If any team member steps onto the sand, the entire team would have to restart from the beginning.  The first team to reach the finish line would win a helicopter trip to the Cerro Negro volcano with volcano surfing and pizza, brownies, and soft drinks.At the Reward Challenge, the team of Chase, Fabio, Jane, Kelly S., and NaOnka cruised to victory.  While on their reward, NaOnka took Fabio aside and filled him in on the plan to vote out Brenda. Kelly S. looked on in surprise and questioned their actions to Chase but he didn't fill her in on the blindside against Brenda. When the losing team returned to camp, they discovered that the three chests had caught fire and burned down, taking with it their machetes and almost all of the tribe's food. After the winning team returned to camp, Chase told Brenda the entire plan to vote her out, but Brenda shrugged it off. Chase again lobbied to vote out Benry to NaOnka, but NaOnka would not budge and she then told Benry, Jane, and Holly that Chase could not be trusted, since he had told Brenda about their plan.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would stand on small platforms and hang on to a rope while leaning backwards over a pool of water.  The rope would have knots tied along its length.  In five-minute intervals, the castaways would have to move further down the rope to the next knot, increasing the angle at which they were hanging over the water.  The last castaway to hang onto the rope would win.At the Immunity Challenge, after a showdown between Jane and Chase, Jane claimed victory; and afterwards, Chase once again lobbied to vote out Benry, but this time to Sash.  NaOnka told Sash about the plan to vote out Brenda and he was then torn between giving the Hidden Immunity Idol to Brenda or letting the plan go through.  At Tribal Council, Brenda called out NaOnka for splitting up the original alliance, while NaOnka tried to deflect the blame onto Chase. Sash and Kelly S. said they both felt it was the first time they had been left out of the loop.

NaOnka felt that Brenda had \"thrown her under the bus\". Holly told NaOnka that she trusted her more now that she had told her about Brenda's plans. Chase thought that the core alliance was himself, Holly, Jane, and NaOnka. On Day 28, the rain returned with a vengeance and made camp life miserable. NaOnka and Kelly S. had doubts that they could continue in the game, as they were both exhausted by the conditions of the weather. NaOnka gave her Hidden Immunity Idol to Chase, and with NaOnka thinking about quitting, the alliance of Chase, Holly and Jane brought in Sash, but he preferred that NaOnka and Kelly S. stayed in the game and considered joining Benry, Dan, and Fabio in an alliance.\n\nReward Challenge: The tribe would be divided into two teams by school yard pick.  The teams would be tethered together and would untie from a table an 8-foot (2.4 m) stuffed dummy named \"Gulliver\" after the novel Gulliver's Travels.  The teams would then carry the dummy through a series of obstacles.  The first team to cross the finish line would win a viewing of the upcoming film of the titular novel, hot dogs, nachos, popcorn, candy, and drinks.At the Reward Challenge, Dan was left out of the challenge from the school yard pick. He decided to back the team of Benry, Chase, Holly, and NaOnka, which meant he would join them if they won the challenge. The choice turned out to be a good one as the four won the closely fought challenge. As soon as the challenge ended, NaOnka announced that she wanted to quit the game. A stunned Jeff asked if anybody else wanted to quit and Kelly S. said that she did. Jeff told the two women that they should think about if they really wanted to quit and that the tribe would meet at Tribal Council that night to sort out the matter. Jeff then offered a tarp and a can of rice to replace the ones lost in the camp fire if one of the winning team members would forgo their reward, to which Holly stepped up and volunteered. Benry tried to make NaOnka step up and volunteer since she had wanted to quit, but NaOnka remained silent. Benry, Chase, Dan, and NaOnka went off to their reward. During the reward, NaOnka gave her hidden immunity idol to Chase because she wanted to quit. Back at camp, Holly tried to convince Kelly S. to stay in the game. Later that night, the five who didn't go on the reward arrived at Tribal Council followed a short time later by the four who did and the members of the jury. Jeff and the tribe discussed what it took to keep the desire to stay in the game and why NaOnka and Kelly S. were considering to quit. Jeff then asked NaOnka if she did want to quit and she replied that she did. Kelly S. was asked the same question and she also stated she wanted to quit. Jeff asked the two women what should happen to their torches. They asked for them to be snuffed as per usual practice, which Jeff agreed to, but then said that the snuffed torches would remain in the Tribal Council area as a reminder to the two women that while they served on the jury, they had quit the game instead of getting voted out. Their torches were then snuffed (and laid down) and the two left Tribal Council and became members of the jury."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US21","season":21,"episode_number_overall":297,"episode":13,"episode_title":"Not Sure Where I Stand","episode_label":"Ep 13","episode_date":"2010-12-08","episode_length":43,"viewers":12130000,"imdb_rating":6.8,"n_ratings":80,"episode_summary":"With NaOnka and Kelly S. quitting, Sash knew that he was the fourth man between the two three-person alliances of Chase/Holly/Jane and Benry/Dan/Fabio.

Chase told Sash that he would take him all the way to the end and that he would take Sash on the next reward along with Holly, since she had given up her last reward.\n\nReward Challenge: The castaways would be given a second chance against previous challenges.  The castaways would crawl in the mud under a net and then retrieve a ball from a stack of hay.  The ball would then have to be bounced off a shield on the ground and into a barrel.  The first four castaways to get their ball into the barrel would advance to the next round.  In the second round, the four castaways would use a stick to retrieve a key suspended above on a metal spring.  The key would unlock a chest that contains four sandbags.  The first two castaways to toss all four of their sandbags on top of a barrel would advance to the final round.  In the final round, the two castaways would use a paddle to dig up three rope rings.

Chase and Benry then advanced to the final round, which was won by Chase.  To join him on the reward, Chase selected Holly and Jane, reneging on his promise to Sash.  While Chase and the women were on their reward, Sash talked to the remaining three guys about joining their alliance, but Dan and Benry were leery about Sash's true alliances and did not trust him.  On the reward, Chase realized that he made a major mistake by not taking Sash on the reward and that he would have to regain Sash's trust.  In order to do so, Chase and Holly came up with a plan to tell Sash that the two would vote out Jane and take Sash to the final three.  Chase also told Benry that Jane would not make it to the final three, to which Benry said that was fine and he was willing to vote out Fabio.  Chase and Holly told Sash that leaving him behind was really a sign of trust in him, since they figured that he was loyal to them and that it would be safe to leave him alone with the Benry/Dan/Fabio alliance.  Sash told Chase and Holly that Benry was lying about being willing to vote for Fabio.  When Benry joined the conversation, the three told him that the next target was Fabio.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would be attached to a rope on a hitching rail and would have to maneuver over and under the rail to unspool the rope from the rail.  When the castaway thinks that there is enough rope unspooled, they would race across a field to retrieve a bag of gold coins.  If they had not unspooled enough rope to reach the bag, they would have to return to the hitching rail and unspool more rope.  The first three castaways to retrieve the bag would advance to the final round.  In the final round, the gold coins would have to be assembled in a puzzle in the shape of a chest.  The first castaway to complete the puzzle would win.At the Immunity Challenge, Fabio, Benry, and Sash advanced to the final round where Sash solved the puzzle ahead of the other two.  After the challenge, Benry, Chase, Dan, and Sash agreed to tell Fabio that the vote would go against Holly, though they would really vote for Fabio.  However, in reality, Sash decided to align himself with the Chase/Holly/Jane alliance and vote out Benry.

Fabio and Chase agreed that if one of them were to win the Reward Challenge, they would take the other on the reward along with Sash.  At the Reward Challenge, Jeff introduced the castaway's loved ones.  The team of Chase and his mother won the challenge.  Chase then selected Sash and his mother and Holly and her husband to join in the challenge, reneging on his promise to Fabio.  Dan, Fabio, and Jane were very upset at Chase's choices.  While on their reward, Chase, Holly, and Sash agreed that they would go to the final three together and that their top priority at this point is to get Fabio voted out.\n\nImmunity Challenge: Blindfolded and connected to a rope, the castaways would go over and under three hitching posts to a station where there would be a shield with various symbols on it.  Using only their sense of touch, the castaways would memorize the symbols and take the three bags of the symbols back to the start line.  There, the castaways would have to replicate the symbols from the shield on to a second shield. Making things more difficult, the bags also contain extra pieces which do not fit on the shield.  The first castaway to have all the correct symbols would win.However, Fabio went on to win the Immunity Challenge the next day, which ruined their plan.  Fabio told Chase that Jane had to go, but Chase was conflicted about the choice between Dan or Jane.  Holly approached Sash and Chase and confirmed that Dan was also on board with voting off Jane. The three of them finally decided that this was the only choice left. Then Jane joined them and asked if her alliance of four with them were still strong.  When the three hesitated in answering her and then finally admitting that they were discussing voting for her, Jane knew that her alliance had turned on her, and proceeded to unleash a tirade against everyone. She flipped them off immediately when she learned of their betrayal, avoided everybody else at camp for the rest of the day, and even dumped a bucket of water on the camp fire shortly before Tribal Council, stating that since she started it, she was going to put it out.  At Tribal Council, Dan told Jeff and the Jury of Jane's recent actions. Jane stated that she was going to be voted out.  After some digging by Jeff, the alliance of three stated that the next castaway voted out after Jane would be Fabio or Dan.  Jeff then asked why Dan, Fabio, and Jane did not form an alliance and vote against Holly to force a tie with Fabio being immune due to his Individual Immunity and Chase and Sash having their Hidden Immunity Idols.  The votes were cast and Chase and Sash played their idols since this Tribal Council would be their last opportunity.  Jeff's suggested alliance did not form and everybody voted for Jane.

At the Immunity Challenge, while Fabio fell behind due to a missed answer on the second question, he quickly caught up to Chase, Holly, and Sash during the puzzle assembly stage and picked up the win.  Fabio talked to Chase and Sash about voting out Holly before Dan using the argument that Holly was a bigger threat than Dan for jury votes.  At Tribal Council, Dan lobbied to keeping him around because nobody would give him a million dollars and that Holly was a threat to win.  However, his lobbying went for naught when he was voted out.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would balance a sword with one hand by its tip on a shield on the ground.

Jeff went over the two's history in the game and then the two drew for tribes. Rob drew the orange Ometepe tribe buff, while Russell drew the purple Zapatera tribe buff. Jeff then announced the new twist of Survivor, which was Redemption Island. At Ometepe, Rob caught Kristina looking for a clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol. Rob then talked to Phillip about keeping an eye out for a woman's alliance on the tribe, since the women outnumbered the men 5–4. However, Phillip was uneasy with the idea and approached Kristina about forming an alliance and siding with the women. Over at Zapatera, Russell made his usual early game move and made an alliance with Stephanie, and talked about taking her to the merge. On Day 3, Kristina went on a hunt for the Hidden Immunity Idol by herself without any clues and actually managed to find it.  Francesca, Kristina, and Phillip then formed an alliance, but Phillip annoyed the women with his aggressive questioning about whom to vote off at Tribal Council.\n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: The tribes would push four blocks along a track which would form a set of stairs to the first level of a temple. The tribe would race to the first level where one tribe member would cut a series of ropes which would release a second set of stairs to the top level of the temple. The tribe would then race to the top level of the temple where there would be a block puzzle. The first tribe to complete their puzzle would win flint and immunity.The first combined Immunity/Reward Challenge was won by Zapatera, when Ometepe fell behind early. They managed to catch up, but at the puzzle part of the challenge they fell behind and lost. After the challenge, Kristina told Francesca and Phillip that she had the Hidden Immunity Idol, and she told Francesca of her plan to blindside Rob by getting the other three Ometepe women to vote for Kristina, while their three person alliance votes for Rob. Francesca was concerned that it was too early to vote out Rob, and that they did not have the numbers to stay in the game long-term. Francesca also wanted to vote out Natalie, as she was seen as the weakest link of the tribe. Rob told the other Ometepe members (Andrea, Ashley, Grant, Matt, and Natalie), that he was concerned that the Francesca/Kristina/Phillip alliance may have already found a Hidden Immunity Idol and they should split their vote between Francesca and Kristina.\nAt Tribal Council, the Francesca/Kristina/Phillip alliance imploded when Francesca openly said that Rob would not be voted out. This enraged Phillip, who immediately responded and said that Francesca told him to vote for Rob. This angered both Francesca and Kristina, and they decided to change their votes to Phillip, both vehemently denied that they were planning to vote out Rob. Phillip openly voiced that he would be voting for Francesca and announced that Kristina had the Hidden Immunity Idol, shocking everyone else on the tribe and silently infuriating Francesca and Kristina. Kristina admitted that she did have the Idol, but she, along with Francesca, still denied that their plan was to vote out Rob, but instead she would be voting for Natalie, even though she did tell Phillip that she was voting for Rob. Jeff asked Rob whose story he believed. Rob said that, while Phillip was adamant in defending his story, Francesca denied it with equal energy. However, Kristina did not defend herself. Rob asked Kristina to show him the Idol just to confirm that she had it. Upon seeing it, he asked her to give him the Idol, declaring that she would stay in the game if she handed it over and that doing so would show that Kristina was telling the truth, but Kristina said she could not hand it over. When the voting came, the alliance of six kept to their plan and split their votes between Francesca and Kristina.

At the fifth station, two tribe members would use the planks to complete a ramp. Finally, the entire tribe would ascend the ramp, one tribe member would untie a hammer and then use it to hammer in three nails that would break three tiles. The first tribe to break all three tiles and place their tools atop the board would win a BBQ set, steak, sausage, bread, vegetables, condiments, and immunity.At the Reward/Immunity Challenge, Zapatera went on to win their third challenge. Back at Ometepe's camp, Kristina tried to hint that there was a clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol within Ometepe's reward and that Grant and Rob may have already found it. Rob kept the knowledge of the idol from his alliance and got Andrea, Ashley, Grant, and Natalie to think that Kristina might have the idol and to split the vote between Kristina and Phillip, favoring Kristina to be voted out. However, Grant and the girls were leaning towards voting out Phillip as he was getting on their last nerves. When Phillip asked Rob whom he should vote for at Tribal Rob told him Kristina, Phillip thought Rob went back on his word about keeping Kristina in the game and decided that he needed to make a move at Tribal Council to keep himself in the game.

The next day at Zapatera, Sarita began to irritate her tribe with an issue regarding her tooth. David told Stephanie that in order to remain in the game, she had to try to break up the alliance and get them to vote for Sarita.

After some celebrating by the castaways, Jeff handed the new tribe a map to a new beach and surprised the tribe by announcing that Redemption Island would still be in play. When the tribe arrived at their new beach, the traditional merger feast was awaiting them. Rob proposed naming the tribe Murlonio, which he claimed was Spanish for \"from the sea, united\", but in reality did not mean anything and was an inside joke between Rob and Amber Mariano named after one of her stuffed animals.

Mike promised Matt to go to the final four with him, even at the expense of his own tribe and the use of the Hidden Immunity Idol.

Mike continued to work on getting Matt to flip even so far as writing a note to Matt promising him final three if he voted for Grant. Matt showed the note to Andrea. Rob took Andrea aside to tell her that the vote was going against Matt. Andrea was torn whether to keep Matt or be the deciding vote to eliminate Grant instead, as it would mean betraying 2 of her 3 main allies- Grant and Rob, and she was now unsure after Matt had revealed their prior plans to Rob whether she could trust Matt moving forward, and also unsure what her situation would then become with Matt having already gone back on his idea of them switching to the Zapatera side.  She also considered telling Matt about the situation but did not. Before the Tribal Council votes were read, Ralph stepped up and told Jeff that he wanted to play the Hidden Immunity Idol on Mike.

The castaways speculated about the wrapped package, thinking it was a set of cards and that they might have to vote out a second person at the upcoming Tribal Council.

Natalie was concerned about Rob keeping Phillip, but promised to Ashley that her next vote would go against Phillip. Phillip openly reported on the girl's discussions, but then took off for a private conversation with Rob.  While the guys were gone, Andrea again lobbied the two other girls in voting out Rob. At Tribal Council, Andrea again lobbied the girls to take control of the game. Rob though pointed out to the others that Andrea was also a huge threat, and proved it again today, and too well liked by jury members to want to take to the end. Andrea then countered by saying the jury were not made up of dummies, and Rob would be an easy choice to win should he be allowed to reach the end, as he had controlled things, while Natalie and Ashley had just followed Rob's orders.  Before the votes were read, Rob pulled out the Hidden Immunity Idol and played it. However, the Idol was not needed as Ashley and Natalie stayed loyal to Rob and voted out Andrea.  At the Reunion show Natalie and Ashley claimed to have known about the Idol, and with this being the last time it could be played, knowing Rob almost certainly was playing it, so possibly voting him out instead of Andrea would have been pointless.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would race through a maze to collect four bags of puzzle pieces at four different stations. Once all four bags were collected, the castaways would race to the top of a pyramid and assemble a word puzzle. The first castaway to correctly solve the puzzle would win immunity.When the castaways returned to camp after Tribal Council, Rob promised the girls that they would go to the final three together. At the Immunity Challenge, Ashley and Rob finished the maze stage, but were stumped by the difficult puzzle. In the end, Rob figured out the puzzle spelled out \"Only You Are Safe\" to win the final Individual Immunity; guaranteeing him a spot in the final Tribal Council. After the challenge, Rob again told the girls that they were safe and to not tell Phillip about their plans. Ashley asked Natalie to tell her if Rob were to change his plans and Natalie promised that she would. Rob told Phillip that Ashley was going home. Rob took Natalie aside try to convince her to vote against Ashley by pointing out that Ashley may have made a connection with the former Zapatera members on the jury and that she was a threat. Ashley again asked Natalie if Rob had said anything about voting against her, but Natalie lied and said that nothing was going on. At Tribal Council, Natalie found herself in a similar predicament Rob had been in with Grant and Natalie last Tribal Council, torn between her friendship with Ashley and her loyalty to Rob. Ashley made the mistake when probed by Jeff by openly stating she had a much better chance of winning the game than either Natalie or Phillip, and could actually beat Rob, but felt she should be taken to the finals anyway due to her game long loyalty. In the end, Natalie sided with Rob by voting for her instead of Phillip to avoid a tie and fire-making challenge, and Ashley became the final member of the jury.\nAt the final Tribal Council, Philip and Natalie both emphasized their loyalty to Rob, with Phillip going so far as to tell the jury that Rob was the mastermind of their entire plan, while he implemented it.[36] The jury was critical of Natalie for her dependence on Rob and her blindside vote for Ashley. Several jury members emphasized their lack of respect for Phillip, who repeatedly grew hostile and confrontational. Rob was both criticized and praised for his aggressive, dominant gameplay and strategy."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US22","season":22,"episode":15,"episode_title":"Reunion","episode_label":"Reunion","episode_date":"2011-05-15","episode_length":35,"viewers":10950000,"imdb_rating":6.6,"n_ratings":89,"episode_summary":"Nearly a year later, the jurors' votes were counted.

Coach and Ozzy disembarked. To determine which tribes the two returnees would join, each randomly drew a paint-filled egg. Crushing their eggs, Coach discovered his was filled with blue paint, meaning he would join Upolu; likewise, the paint inside Ozzy's egg was red, meaning he would join Savaii.  While all of Savaii was openly pleased that Ozzy was part of their tribe, Coach's welcome to Upolu was cold, with only Edna showing him kindness.  Amidst the ceremony, John requested that Jeff call him by his last name, Cochran, in the vein of past castaways that Jeff was fond of.\n\nReward challenge: Coach and Ozzy would represent their tribes by climbing a 12-foot (3.7 m) pole to retrieve a wooden turtle.  They would then have to dig themselves under a log.  Finally, they would solve a six-level Tower of Hanoi puzzle with the turtle as the top piece to win taro and flint.Jeff explained that Redemption Island was in play and that a reward challenge would begin immediately between Coach and Ozzy representing their tribes. They both struggled with the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, requesting help from their tribes. Savaii's assistance was pivotal and Ozzy took the win. When Upolu arrived at their campsite, Coach tried to charm his tribe and overcome his cold greeting.  Meanwhile, Christine went off to look for the hidden immunity idol, which roused suspicion among her teammates. Brandon found himself struggling with a secret, being the nephew of the infamous Russell Hantz -- a fact which would be a daunting challenge for Brandon to hide for long as he had the words \"Little Hantz\" tattooed on his back and arm. During a nighttime conversation, Coach formed an impromptu alliance with Albert, Brandon, Rick, and Sophie. Over at Savaii, Mark asked to be called \"Papa Bear\", which the rest of his tribe thought was odd but accepted nonetheless. On day 2, Dawn had a minor emotional breakdown, which concerned Papa Bear and Ozzy.\n\nImmunity challenge: The tribes would race through an obstacle course of zigzagging pathways, through a web of strung up coconuts, and over a 10-foot (3.0 m) wall.  One tribe member would then dig up a machete and use it to cut five ropes which would release a bin of coconuts.  Three tribe members would then shoot the coconuts through a hoop into a net.  When enough coconuts were shot into the net, their combined weight would raise a flag.  The first tribe to raise their flag would win.The first immunity challenge was won by Upolu in a close match. In addition to tribal immunity, Upolu received flint and was told that a clue to the hidden immunity idol was hidden at their campsite.  When Savaii returned to camp, Semhar and Jim had an argument about Semhar's effort and Jim's criticism at the immunity challenge. Most of the tribe wanted to vote out Semhar due to her failure at the coconut throwing stage of the challenge, for which she had volunteered. Ozzy, however, having bonded with Semhar, suggested that the tribe consider voting out Cochran for being physically inept. Jim was suspicious about Ozzy's reasons for keeping Semhar in the game. Ozzy told Semhar that she needed to lobby the others in voting out Cochran. Jim told Cochran about Ozzy's suggestion and Cochran became paranoid that he would be voted out. At Tribal Council, the tribe debated if Semhar or Cochran was to remain in the tribe.  When the vote came, the tribe decided to vote out Semhar unanimously and she became the first resident of Redemption Island."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US23","season":23,"episode_number_overall":315,"episode":2,"episode_title":"He Has Demons","episode_label":"Ep 2","episode_date":"2011-09-21","episode_length":43,"viewers":10460000,"imdb_rating":7.3,"n_ratings":88,"episode_summary":"On Redemption Island, Semhar recited poetry to comfort herself over feeling abandoned by her tribe. At Upolu, Coach, not having forgotten Edna's earlier kindness toward him, allowed her to join his alliance, albeit as a sixth, outlying member. In keeping his relation to Russell Hantz a secret and with guilt eating at him, Brandon revealed his secret to Coach and asked him to keep it to himself. Brandon gave his word that he would stick with Coach and their alliance. Christine found the clue to the whereabouts of the hidden immunity idol, but her persistent efforts to find the idol further alienated her from the rest of the tribe. Brandon continued to project sinister and sordid motivations in Mikayla's simple camp activities and felt very uncomfortable around her, saying that she reminded him of Parvati Shallow.  Because of this, Brandon wanted Mikayla voted out as soon as possible. At Savaii, Ozzy used his past Survivor experience and looked for things out of place and discovered the hidden immunity idol. Jim put forth a \"3 plus 2\" alliance plan of himself, Keith, and Ozzy as a core alliance with Elyse and Whitney as the \"plus 2\".\n\nReward/Immunity challenge: Four members from each tribe would unwind ribbons from a maypole to release a set of keys. One of the four would then use the keys to free four other tribemates. Those four tribemates would then push crates around a platform to clear the way for a large crate to pass under a pole. The entire tribe would then carry the large crate to a finish platform. The first tribe to have their large crate onto the finish platform would win pillows, blankets, a hammock, a mat, and immunity.At the combined reward/immunity challenge, the men of Upolu blew a huge lead going into the crate stage of the challenge, allowing Savaii to come from behind and win the challenge. Back at camp, most of the core Upolu alliance had settled on targeting the outsider of the tribe, Christine, but were also wary about the possibility of her having found a hidden immunity idol -- so Coach suggested to his alliance that they protect themselves by splitting their votes between Christine and her only ally, Stacey. Brandon, however, expressed his desire to vote out Mikayla instead. Coach, trying to maintain control of the alliance, insisted that they stick to the plan of splitting the vote. Still wanting to eliminate Mikayla first, Brandon lied to Coach and told him that Christine and Stacey would vote for Mikayla. At Tribal Council, Coach confronted Christine and Stacey about their votes.  Christine and Stacey denied they had ever said they would vote for Mikayla.  When they asked who Coach had heard that from, Coach refused to say until Brandon confessed to telling the two women to vote against Mikayla. When the vote came, the alliance of six along with Mikayla followed Coach's plan and split their vote, casting four against Christine and three against Stacey.

At regular intervals, the player would add an additional section to the bottom of the pole, making the pole longer and harder to balance. The last castaway still holding the totem up would win.Before the duel started, Semhar recited more poetry to calm herself, but it did not help and she lost to Christine. On day 7 at Upolu, Brandon felt guilty about lying to his tribe during his push to vote out Mikayla. He finally told them the truth about his family, displayed his tattoos and apologized for continuing to lie to them. In private, Brandon and Mikayla discussed why he wanted to vote her out. After Brandon felt threatened by her demeanor, he gathered the rest of the tribe and told them all that he was very upset at Mikayla's approach, that she did not appear to have much of an alliance, and to keep him out of all tribal drama. Coach was concerned that Brandon's outburst would cause friction within the tribe and his alliance. At Savaii, Ozzy decided that he had to trust somebody with the knowledge of his hidden immunity idol discovery and he decided upon telling Keith. Keith then told Whitney in order to gain her trust.\n\nReward/Immunity challenge: A tribe member would race across a floating bridge carrying a bodyboard attached to a rope. The tribe member would grab a bag containing a banner that would form part of their tribe's flag. They would then ride the bodyboard back to shore as it was winched in by the four members of their tribe. Five bundles would need to be winched to the beach in this manner. Two tribe members would then use grappling hooks from the top of a wall to retrieve the five banners. Finally, the two tribe members would assemble the banners into their tribe's flag. The first tribe to have their flag completed would win chocolate, cookies, coffee, powdered milk, tea, sugar, and immunity.The tribes were neck-in-neck until the grappling hook stage of the challenge; while Elyse and Whitney struggled with their grappling hook, Coach and Edna blazed far ahead of them and won the challenge for Upolu. Back at Savaii, Cochran and Papa Bear shared their fear that one of them would be going to Redemption Island after Tribal Council and that the other would go at the next Tribal Council. The rest of the tribe decided on voting out Papa Bear, viewing him as their weakest link, but would tell him that they would be voting for Cochran. Ozzy told Cochran about the plan in an attempt to preemptively quell any paranoia from Cochran. When Jim and Ozzy told Papa Bear that Cochran was going home, Papa Bear saw through their lie and he went to search for the hidden immunity idol in a last ditch effort to save himself. Elyse and Jim followed Papa Bear into the woods to watch him look for the idol.  Failing to find the idol, Papa Bear decided to create a false idol in order to fool the tribe into thinking he had one. Papa Bear then set his plan in motion, telling Jim that he had found the idol. Cochran correctly surmised that Papa Bear's idol was fake, but Cochran was still concerned that everyone else would fall for Papa Bear's scheme and shift the vote from Papa Bear to Cochran. At Tribal Council, the tribe ultimately voted to call Papa Bear's bluff and he was sent to Redemption Island."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US23","season":23,"episode_number_overall":317,"episode":4,"episode_title":"Survivalism","episode_label":"Ep 4","episode_date":"2011-10-05","episode_length":43,"viewers":10720000,"imdb_rating":7,"n_ratings":89,"episode_summary":"Jim was concerned that Ozzy and Elyse had a tighter bond than people realized and that he could not vote out Ozzy, so he confided with Cochran about a plan to vote out Elyse next.

He apologized to Mikayla for his recent outburst in front of the tribe. He then confessed to Edna that she was not actually part of the core alliance of Albert, Brandon, Coach, Rick, and Sophie, but merely a sixth, disposable member, much to Edna's shock and disappointment. Cochran, Jim, Brandon, and Edna went to observe the Redemption Island duel.\n\nRedemption Island duel: The castaways would toss sand bags and attempt to land them on top of ten crates. The first castaway to have one bag on all ten crates would win.Before the duel started, Brandon apologized to Christine for his rash behavior toward her during Upolu's first Tribal Council. Acknowledging the apology, Christine edged out Papa Bear to win her second duel in a row. Once Brandon and Edna returned to camp, Edna, now on edge about her status in the tribe due to Brandon's earlier confession to her, decided that she had to emphasize the social aspect of her game by being cordial and polite.  However, she overplayed her \"be nice to everyone\" strategy; due to her constant talking and laughing, Edna just ended up irritating Mikayla and Stacey. At Savaii, Cochran approached Dawn about voting out Elyse next.\n\nReward/Immunity challenge: Three castaways, two men and one woman, from each tribe would stand on perches holding a wooden pole on their shoulders to which weighted bags would be added. Every few minutes, the other four members of the opposing tribe would select someone to bear an additional 20 pounds (9.1 kg) of weight, ergo making it increasingly more difficult for the weight bearers to hold onto their poles; if a weight bearer drops their pole, they would be out of the challenge. The tribe whose weight bearers all drop out of the challenge first loses. The winning tribe is awarded two chicken hens, one rooster, and immunity.At the combined reward/immunity challenge, Savaii chose Dawn, Jim, and Keith to be the weight bearers while Upolu chose Albert, Brandon, and Stacey. Keith dropped out first after 26 minutes and 180 pounds (82 kg). Albert was out next at the same weight. Jim and Brandon surpassed the Survivor record of 220 pounds (100 kg) held by Rupert Boneham in Survivor: Pearl Islands and James \"J.T.\" Thomas Jr. and Brendan Synnott in Survivor: Tocantins by going to 240 pounds (110 kg), but both dropped their poles shortly after the last 20 pounds (9.1 kg) were added. Finally, Stacey dropped her pole at 140 pounds (64 kg), leaving Dawn as the last weight bearer standing, also with 140 pounds (64 kg) as her final weight held total, giving Savaii the win. Stacey expressed her frustration over being the next target for elimination in her tribe due to her previous ties with Christine, even though she believed she had proven herself to be a strong competitor with her performance in the challenge. Stacey appealed to Coach, implying that she deserved to stay over Edna, whom Stacey viewed as annoying and weak. However, Coach confessed that while he \"understood\" Stacey and where she was coming from, she was still not safe. Stacey then tried to stir things up by lying to Brandon, telling him that he needed to watch out for Albert, Mikayla, and Sophie, because the three of them might have formed their own secret alliance. Panicked, Brandon relayed the news to Coach, but Coach cut him off and told him that Stacey knew she was getting voted out next and would say anything to save herself. Annoyed about Brandon's actions, Coach and Sophie mulled over the possibility of kicking Brandon out of the core alliance at some point. At Tribal Council, Brandon broke down emotionally for feeling that he had something to prove by being Russell Hantz's relative and that he had to reclaim the family name in a positive manner. The tribe then discussed their issues of trust and loyalty.

The ball would travel down a spiraling metal track and exit out of one of two points. The castaway would have to catch the ball and drop the ball back into the chute at the top. Every few minutes, an additional ball would be added to the track until six balls were simultaneously going around the track. A turnstile gate in the middle of the track would rotate, causing the balls to alternate exiting out of the two exits. If a ball exits the track and is not caught, the castaway would be eliminated from the challenge.Christine and Stacey lambasted Albert and Mikayla, and told Dawn and Whitney that Coach, whom they declined to call Coach, but instead used his real name, Benjamin, was in complete control, Albert was Coach's right-hand man, and the entire tribe were liars. Christine won her third duel in a row. When Albert and Mikayla returned to camp, they told the tribe about Stacey's venting, which upset Coach as he felt it would put a target on his back. Albert found the clue to the hidden immunity idol, but when he couldn't find the Idol itself, he told Coach and Sophie about the clue to enhance their trust in him. Coach found the hidden immunity idol and told his new sub-alliance of three.\n\nReward/Immunity challenge: Using only their mouths, the castaways would rip pieces of meat off a large pork roast and put it into a basket.

Over at Upolu, Brandon found the clue to the hidden immunity idol and shared it with Coach and Albert. Brandon went on the hunt without knowing that Coach already had the idol. Coach and Albert agreed that telling Brandon that they already had the idol would cause him to fly off the handle.\n\nRedemption Island duel: The castaways would play a variation of shuffleboard.

Over at Upolu, Edna continued cozying up with Coach in order to improve her outlier status with the core alliance of five. On day 15, Ozzy realized that his temper tantrum after Tribal Council was a mistake and tried to patch things up with the tribe.\n\nReward/Immunity challenge: Three castaways from each tribe would assemble a wheelbarrow and then push the wheelbarrow around a series of obstacles. Along the way, they would stop at two stations and collect a load of coconuts. At the end of the obstacle course, the three tribe members would dump out the coconuts into a box. The three other castaways would then disassemble the wheelbarrow and reassemble it into a sling shot. They would use the coconuts as ammunition for the slingshot to knock down six targets. The first tribe to knock all six of their targets down would win a trip to the \"sliding rocks\", a waterfall where people can slide down the rocks into a pool below, a picnic lunch, and immunity.At the combined reward/immunity challenge, Savaii struggled during the first half of the challenge, falling way behind Upolu. When Mikayla missed several shots with the slingshot, Coach told her to sit out and let someone else shoot, but she refused and stubbornly kept trying, continuing to miss. Meanwhile, Jim and Keith proved to be adept with their slingshot, allowing Savaii to overcome the deficit and take the win. Coach angrily blamed Upolu's upset loss on Mikayla and privately expressed satisfaction that he wouldn't have to deal with her for much longer, as she was the core alliance's next target. Albert, however, having befriended Mikayla and believing her to be an asset to the tribe, began a campaign to keep Mikayla, arguing that Edna should go instead. Sophie agreed with Albert to vote out Edna. Brandon, however, refused to go along with Albert's plan, arguing that the core alliance had a duty to stay true to their original agreement to vote out Mikayla next. Albert and Sophie then tried to convince Coach that Edna was their weakest link and the tribe still needed Mikayla's strength. However, Coach remained steadfast in his decision to vote out Mikayla, claiming that Edna was much more trustworthy than Mikayla, and he felt that was more important going into the merge. With the alliance split, Rick became the swing vote and Coach and Albert each lobbied hard to win Rick over.

Edna, however, secretly hoped that Brandon's behavior would continue, as it might shift the next target from her to him.\n\nRedemption Island duel: The castaways would dismantle a box and use the pieces as planks to build a bridge. Once they cross the bridge, they would use some of the planks to solve a pattern puzzle. The first castaway to solve their puzzle would win.Sophie, Albert, Ozzy, and Cochran witnessed the duel between Christine and Mikayla. Despite the verbal support that Mikayla received from Albert and Sophie, Christine won her fifth Redemption Island duel in a row in a closely fought match. With Christine's continued domination at the duels and the possibility that Savaii might lose the next challenge, Ozzy began to consider volunteering to be sent to Redemption Island so that he could defeat Christine ahead of a tribal merge. A win by him would mean that the tribes would go into the merge in equal numbers. He approached Cochran about his plan and also offered to give his hidden immunity idol to someone to hold for him while he was at Redemption Island. At Upolu, Coach tried to inspire his tribe by having them all \"find\" the hidden immunity idol. Coach, Albert, and Sophie staged a hunt for the idol for the others. While passing the tree mail stand, Coach and Sophie found a package announcing the upcoming challenge, so they took the opportunity to announce they had \"two pieces of great news\": the upcoming challenge and the \"finding\" of the hidden immunity idol.\n\nReward/Immunity challenge: The tribes would split off in pairs of castaways. One pair would act as callers to the two other pairs as they navigate blindfolded and hooked to a rope through an obstacle course to collect four bags of masks. One pair of castaways would then use only their sense of touch with no help from the rest of the tribe to match the masks into pairs. The first pair to properly match all eight masks would win for their tribe a screening of Jack and Jill and immunity.Both tribes considered the reward/immunity challenge to be crucial, since they had correctly suspected that it was the final tribal challenge of the game and the tribe that won it would secure all of their members going into the merge, and would potentially have a numbers advantage depending on who returned from Redemption Island. Upolu chose Coach and Rick as their callers/rope handlers, while Savaii used Jim and Cochran. The tribes were neck-in-neck through most of the challenge, but on the final heat, Cochran struggled to get Ozzy and Whitney properly hooked into their rope. Savaii fell behind and never recovered, and Upolu ecstatically took the pivotal win. Cochran's entire tribe was extremely upset over his incompetence in the challenge, which concerned Cochran that Ozzy might renege on his plan to volunteer to go to Redemption Island. Sure enough, when Savaii got back to camp, they blamed the loss on Cochran and told him that he could redeem himself at Redemption Island. However, by the next morning, the anger at Cochran had subsided. Ozzy retrieved the hidden immunity idol, presented it to the tribe, and put forth his volunteer plan. Jim and Keith were concerned about Ozzy volunteering to be voted out since if the merge did not happen the next day, the tribe would be weaker with Cochran competing in the next challenge rather than Ozzy. At Tribal Council, Ozzy offered his plan to volunteer with the twist that he would tell Christine that Cochran had found the hidden immunity idol and used it to blindside Ozzy. Before the votes were read, Ozzy handed the idol to Cochran and made Cochran promise to give it back to Ozzy in the event that Ozzy won the right to return to the game.

Both tribes arrived to witness the Redemption Island duel and Upolu was stunned to see Ozzy in the duel. When asked by Jeff if he was surprised to be here,  Ozzy laid it on thick with the resentment towards Cochran on being voted out, but Albert and Coach were suspect about the act. After Jeff announced the rules of the duel, he announced that the winner would return to the game. Ozzy crushed Christine at the duel when he retrieved all his keys and walked through the doorway before Christine was able to retrieve a single key. Jeff told Ozzy that he was back in the game and that the tribes had merged. After the traditional merge feast, Cochran took Coach aside and attempted to infiltrate Upolu's ranks, as per Savaii's plan, but Coach saw right through Cochran's lies and laid out exactly what the former Savaii members were scheming. Assuring Cochran that Upolu wasn't going to fall for Savaii's trap, Coach then gave Cochran a choice: either stay with Savaii and leave the elimination at the next Tribal Council up to chance after an evenly split vote, or truly defect from Savaii and vote with Upolu, guaranteeing Cochran's safety in the dominant alliance. Cochran decided to leave his old tribe and he told Upolu all about Savaii's plans and tribal politics. Cochran kept his word and returned the hidden immunity idol to Ozzy.

They thought Upolu would vote against Whitney, so Ozzy would hand the hidden immunity idol to Whitney at Tribal Council. Little did they know that Cochran immediately told Sophie about Savaii's plan. Dawn asked Cochran what he was going to do and he told her that he was thinking of flipping tribes. While she had earlier considered joining Cochran, she now wanted to stay loyal to the tribe and warned him to not flip. At Tribal Council, Upolu declared that they saw through Savaii's charade at the Redemption Island duel. Ozzy told them to call their bluff. Before the votes were read, Ozzy played the hidden immunity idol for Whitney. But thanks to Cochran having earlier spilled Savaii's entire plan to Upolu, Whitney received no votes and Savaii's idol was wasted.  Instead, the vote was split along tribal lines with six votes apiece against Keith and Rick. Jeff called for a revote with the castaways only being able to vote for Keith or Rick. On the second vote, Cochran flipped to the Upolu alliance, sending Keith to Redemption Island.

The first four to successfully land a coconut into the hole would move on to the second round. In the second round, the four castaways would crack open coconuts, take the coconut water into their mouths, and then run through an obstacle course. At the end of the course, the castaways would spit out the coconut water into a tube and then repeat the course until the tube was filled. The first castaway to fill their tube would win.At the immunity challenge, Dawn, Whitney, Jim, and Sophie made it to the second round. In the second round, Jim beat out Sophie after Sophie gagged on the mouthful of coconut water that would have won the challenge. Back at camp, Jim came up with a plan to stir up Tribal Council by giving the Immunity Necklace to Ozzy and then making a rousing speech to get two of the Upolu tribe to vote against Cochran. When Tribal Council came, Jim and Ozzy made several rousing speeches, but Jim did not hand over the Immunity Necklace because Upolu threatened him before Tribal Council that if he gave his Immunity Necklace to Ozzy, he would be voted out.[32] This sealed Ozzy's fate and he was sent back to Redemption Island, with Dawn and Whitney voting with the Upolu alliance.\n\nImmunity challenge: While balancing barefoot on a beam that narrows in three stages, the castaways would hold a wooden bow with a ball balanced on top.

The former Upolu tribe, and Cochran, opted out of the challenge in order to feast, leaving the immunity to be decided between Dawn, Jim, and Whitney. Whitney beat out Dawn to win Individual Immunity. Knowing that he was most likely going to be voted out next, Jim approached Albert and Sophie about joining the remaining former Savaii members in blindsiding Edna, but Albert and Sophie weren't budging.  Albert came up with an alternative plan to vote out Dawn, seeing her as a bigger threat than Jim; Dawn was endearing herself to the Upolu alliance, and Albert feared that she might find a way to infiltrate their ranks.

Any movement in their hands would cause the poles to drop to the ground.  The last person who does not drop their poles would win.At the Redemption Island duel between Jim, Keith, and Ozzy, after Jeff explained the rules of the competition, he revealed that only one person would move on, and the two losers would become the first and second members of the jury. Jim faltered first and became the first member of the jury. Keith dropped out next to become the second jury member. On Redemption Island, Ozzy thought the situation of no stress and abundant food allowed him to recharge and be a bigger physical threat towards the end game. Over at Te Tuna, Cochran thought about trying to regain some of the trust he lost from Dawn and Whitney by helping them last further in the game.\n\nImmunity challenge: The castaways would fill a bowl with rice and balance it on their head while crossing over two teeter-totters. They would then dump the rice into a basket on a third teeter-totter. If a castaway touches the bowl or drops it, they would need to go back to the start.

After Jeff awarded the Immunity Necklace, he said that there would be a twist at Tribal Council. Back at camp, Dawn and Whitney talked to Albert and Cochran about blindsiding one of the Upolu alliance. Albert considered blindsiding Edna which would curry favor from the former Savaii jury members. Albert told Cochran that he would be voted out seventh and his plan to blindside Edna. Albert also told Sophie about his plan as she would be the swing vote. Coach, however, became suspicious of Albert and decided that he needed to lay down the law, threatening that anybody who betrayed the Upolu alliance \"would be dead\". At Tribal Council, the Upolu alliance stayed intact and Dawn was sent to Redemption Island.\n\nImmunity challenge: The castaways would be asked a series of survival related questions. If a castaway were to answer the question incorrectly, they would be out of the challenge.

Cochran requested that they keep him in the game for at least one more Tribal Council as he felt that they owed him for flipping over to their side, giving them the pivotal vote that they needed to defeat Savaii.  To further strengthen the guilt trip that he was trying to lay on the core Upolu alliance, Cochran also told a lie to them that his birthday was near and he wanted to celebrate it in the game. After Cochran left, the Upolu men mulled over the possibility of sparing Cochran from the next vote, getting rid of Edna instead.  Sophie shot the idea down, however, arguing that Edna had seniority in the Upolu alliance over Cochran, and that the core members were just as indebted to Edna for her unwavering loyalty as they were to Cochran for flipping.\n\nRedemption Island duel: The castaways would balance ceramic dishes on the end of a balancing arm.  As the challenge progresses, Jeff would call out different dishwares that the castaways would stack on the far end of the balance.  Should any part of a castaways's stack fall, that castaway would be out of the challenge.  The last castaway in the challenge would win.At the Redemption Island duel, Ozzy beat out Dawn and Whitney, who became the third and fourth members of the jury. On day 29, the tribe became frustrated with Albert's laziness around camp. Edna asked Coach for advice on how to make it further than sixth place ahead of Cochran.  Coach found himself second-guessing his original plans, as he felt that he could trust Cochran and Edna the most.\n\nReward/Immunity challenge: The castaways would replay previous challenges. In the first stage, the castaways would toss sand bags and attempt to land them on top of three crates. The three castaways to have one bag on all three crates would move on. In the final stage, the castaways would use the coconuts as ammunition for the slingshot to knock down three targets. The first castaway to knock all three of their targets down would win a spa afternoon with a shower and a massage and immunity.At the reward/immunity challenge, Albert, Rick, and Sophie moved on to the final round. In the final round, Albert beat out Rick. After the challenge was over, Jeff told Albert that he could choose somebody to join him in the reward and he picked Coach. Albert then asked if he could choose another, but when Jeff told him that he could not, Albert asked if he could give up his reward. Jeff allowed that and Albert, believing Cochran's earlier birthday lie, gave up his reward to Cochran as a gift. During the massage, Coach told Cochran that he would fight to keep Cochran in the game. After returning from the spa trip, Cochran tried to convince Albert to vote out Rick and Albert agreed if Coach and Edna would join them. Cochran then told Edna about his and Albert's tentative plans and she excitedly agreed to it, seeing it as a much-needed opportunity to further herself in the game. When Cochran told Coach about the plan, Coach was unsure of whether to stay loyal to his original alliance or create a new one with Albert, Cochran, and Edna. At Tribal Council, Cochran again pushed his feeling that the Upolu alliance owed him a debt. Edna voiced her sadness in being \"a junior member\" of the Upolu alliance. When Brandon openly declared that he would vote out Cochran and then Edna next, as per the core Upolu alliance's original plans, Brandon's lack of strategic play was discussed.

On day 31, Edna expressed her anger and frustration over being the core Upolu alliance's next target, being especially livid that Brandon, whom she greatly disliked, was playing a role in dictating her fate in the game. In the middle of Edna making a tearful plea to Coach to spare her from the next vote, Brandon interrupted the conversation when he burst into camp, yelling that the tribe had received tree mail with a Sprint HTC Evo 3D. The phone contained video messages from the castaways' loved ones: Coach's brother Pete, Sophie's father Thurston, Edna's sister Debbie, Brandon's father Shawn, Albert's mom Annie and Rick's wife Katy.\n\nRedemption Island duel: The castaways would toss a grappling hook to retrieve three bags with a ball inside. They would then use one of those balls to finish a labyrinth game.  The first to finish would win.At the Redemption Island duel, Jeff took the phone back and announced that there was a twist to the duel, but that he would get to it later. While Cochran struggled during the grappling hook stage, he caught up during the labyrinth game and was just barely edged out by Ozzy. After Cochran departed the Redemption Island Arena, Jeff brought out all of the castaways' loved ones. Jeff then tasked Ozzy with choosing three people to spend some time with their loved ones. Ozzy picked Albert and his mother, Coach and his brother, and Brandon and his father. After Edna, Rick, and Sophie left the Arena, Jeff handed the phone back to Ozzy and told the seven that they would be spending their time at Redemption Island. During the visit, Coach took the opportunity to promise Ozzy that \"as a Christian man\" that they would go to the final three should he return to the game. Brandon's father tried to convince Brandon that he needed to play to win, not to always play with honor. Brandon's father then told Coach that Brandon would follow any orders Coach would give as long as he took Brandon to the final three, but Coach was annoyed at the attempted manipulation.\n\nImmunity challenge: The castaways would play on a grid of hexagons. They would start by standing on a hexagon and step to an adjoining hexagon. As they move, they would flip over the hexagon they were just on, indicating that the hexagon was no longer in play. Each castaway would continue to move until they could no longer make a move. The last castaway to be able to make a move would win.During the immunity challenge, after Brandon made his final move, he announced that he was making moves to prevent \"a particular person\" from winning immunity. Edna, irked by his statements, cut him off and told him to go ahead and just name her. In the end, Coach beat out Edna by a wide margin to take Individual Immunity. When the tribe returned to camp, Sophie and Rick expressed their disapproval of Brandon's actions toward Edna during the challenge. Brandon attempted to apologize to Edna, but Edna did not accept it as she thought it was insincere. Edna appealed to Albert, Coach, and Sophie to follow the tribe's mantra of playing with \"Honor. Loyalty. Integrity.\" and to vote Brandon out for going against those values. Edna then took Coach aside, asking him to either pass the Immunity Necklace to her or give her the hidden immunity idol, but Coach refused, saying that he would potentially ruin his own game if he did. Not giving up, Edna went back to Albert and Sophie, proposing that the three of them and Coach make a final four pact.  Believing that Edna would be an easy person to beat in the finals, Albert took her plan into consideration. At Tribal Council, Edna lambasted Brandon for his erratic behavior and his rudeness toward her.  Edna then argued to the rest of the Upolu alliance that if they truly believed in their mantra, they would keep her and vote out Brandon.

They would then use the hatchet to cut a rope which would drop a bag of four cubes with colored sides. The castaways would have to stack the cubes such that there would be no repeating colors on each side. The first castaway to properly stack the cubes would win.At the Redemption Island duel, even though Edna received verbal assistance from the remaining castaways, Ozzy was able to continue his win streak at the duels. When Te Tuna returned to camp, Albert talked to Brandon about blindsiding Sophie. Meanwhile, Sophie told Coach and Rick that they had to send Brandon to Redemption Island as Brandon and Ozzy were the most dangerous players in the game. Albert approached Coach about voting against Sophie, but Coach figured that Albert was running scared. When Brandon interrupted Albert and Coach's conversation, Coach thought Brandon was bullying the two of them and became angry at Brandon. Coach felt that Brandon was acting like his uncle, Russell, and that he had to be voted off next. After Coach apologized for bringing up Russell, Brandon asked for reassurance that everything was okay.\n\nReward/Immunity challenge: The castaways would use a rope to climb a wall to collect five bags of puzzle pieces. Once all five bags were collected, the 15 puzzle pieces would have to be sorted into matching pairs. Three of the pieces would be unmatchable. These three pieces would reveal a numeric code that would be used to unlock a combination lock on a box at the top of the wall. The first castaway to unlock their box would win pizza and soft drinks to be delivered to camp and immunity.At the immunity challenge, Brandon beat the tribe to win Individual Immunity. After putting the immunity necklace around Brandon's neck, Jeff handed Brandon a pizza menu and told him to select one person to join him. Brandon, declaring that his selection was from the heart and not strategic, selected Rick. Brandon's win scrambled Coach and Sophie's plan to vote out Brandon so they switched their target to Albert. While Brandon and Rick were enjoying their reward, Sophie told them that she was voting for Albert. Rick told Sophie and Brandon that Albert told Rick that they were going to the final three together. This led to a four-way argument between Albert, Brandon, Rick, and Sophie over who made what promises to whom and who was lying. Albert went into damage control with Brandon. Brandon felt Albert did not intend to deceive him, that he deserved forgiveness, and that God was telling him to keep Albert in the game. Brandon went as far as offering Albert his Individual Immunity at Tribal Council figuring that neither Albert or Coach would vote against him and he would be safe. When Brandon told Coach about his plan, Coach sought his own divine wisdom about whom he should vote against. At the outset of Tribal Council, Brandon declared that he wanted to give up his Individual Immunity. A stunned Jeff and jury watched Brandon hand over the necklace to Albert. Brandon explained his actions by saying that he was staying true to the commitments he had made and he would give up his own place in the game to keep those commitments. Rick revealed that Coach had the hidden immunity idol. When asked by Jeff if he would give the Individual Immunity back to Brandon if he felt Brandon was in danger, Albert said that he did not feel Brandon was in danger and would not give the necklace back.

With his sixth straight win, Ozzy re-entered the game. When the five returned to camp, Coach took Ozzy aside to tell him that he wanted to take him to the final three and would be willing to give Ozzy the hidden immunity idol if necessary.

With the other hand, the castaways would build a tower out of wood blocks to a certain height on one end of the balancing board. The first castaway to build their tower high enough would win.At the immunity challenge, during the middle of the challenge when Sophie was ahead of Ozzy, but had a partial collapse of her tower, she ordered Albert to drop his own efforts in order to help her pick up her dropped blocks. However, Jeff cut off the order by stating that the castaways could not receive any help from other castaways. Sophie never recovered, allowing Ozzy to beat out Coach to win Individual Immunity. When the tribe returned to camp, Coach wanted to vote out Rick as he thought Rick would be a threat for jury votes. Ozzy suggested to Albert to vote out Sophie. Rick also suggested to Coach that they vote for Sophie. At Tribal Council, Coach wore the hidden immunity idol around his neck, leaving the choices of votes to Albert, Rick, and Sophie.

At the immunity challenge, Ozzy retrieved all of his puzzle pieces first, but struggled in getting the puzzle started. Once Sophie had the first piece of the puzzle locked in, she quickly caught up and passed Ozzy to win the final immunity challenge. With the loss, Ozzy knew that he was likely to be going home, but he made a pitch to Coach to force a tie at Tribal Council by appealing to Coach's desire to take warriors to the end. At Tribal Council, Coach was torn between staying loyal to his original alliance or allowing Ozzy to take on Albert in a fire starting challenge. In the end, Coach voted against Ozzy and he became the final member of the jury.\nAlbert, Coach, and Sophie enjoyed the traditional day 39 breakfast. At the final Tribal Council, the jury ripped into the final three for actions or questioned their strategies in the game.

Jeff then told the tribes that they had sixty seconds to strip everything of value from the truck. While the women of Salani were busy gathering goods, Michael stole several of their assembled supplies. After the scramble for supplies was done, Jeff tossed the two tribes a map to their camps and the tribes headed off in different directions.\nDuring Salani's trek through the jungle, Alicia formed an alliance with Chelsea, Kat, Kim, and Sabrina.

The Survivor Medical Team determined that she had a possible broken wrist and pulled her from the challenge to get an X-ray for further diagnosis. Jeff told the tribes that since the challenge requires nine castaways to start and finish, Manono wins by default. However, he gave the men the option to continue the challenge with a nine versus eight competition as a gesture of goodwill. The men declined and took the Tribal Immunity, much to the disappointment of the women. \nThat night, at Tribal Council, a vicious argument broke out between Alicia and Christina over the deal made over the fire and palm frond mats.

The first tribe to knock out 5 targets in either a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line would win a choice of one of three rewards: a mattress, blankets and pillows; a tarp; or donuts, coffee, sugar, and creamer.The Reward Challenge was won by Salani and they selected the tarp as their reward. Back at camp, Leif told Bill that Colton wanted to vote Bill out at the last Tribal Council. When Michael told Colton that he saw Bill and Leif having a conversation, Colton confronted Leif about what he told Bill. After Leif admitted that he told Bill about being targeted, Colton told Leif that he picked the wrong side and that his fate in the game was sealed. Leif knew that he lost the trust of his alliance and had to regain their trust.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The tribes would divide into pairs and, cuffed together, race across interspersed teeter-totters to solve increasingly difficult puzzles,  each time collecting a key.

At the challenge, Alicia and Chelsea struggled at solving the first puzzle, even with the help of looking at the men's completed puzzle, and the men had an easy win. Back at camp, Sabrina told Kim that Alicia was the weakest link and she had to go, which unsettled Kim. At Manono, Leif confided in Bill that he had been targeted by the tribe for removal prior to the Challenge. Bill tried to make peace with Colton, but Colton refused any conversation and an argument ensued. After the confrontation, Colton proposed to the other men that they give the Tribal Immunity to Salani, go to Tribal Council, and vote out Bill. Angry at Leif for the perceived betrayal, Colton and Tarzan told Leif that he was going to be voted out next and browbeat the rest of the men into giving up Tribal Immunity. Manono became the first tribe in Survivor history to voluntarily give up tribal immunity, which left Jeff awestruck. He then grilled the men on why they were there, especially since there was no reward for them. Leif appeared to throw himself at the mercy of his alliance, and Colton and Bill argued over Bill's choice in careers, Colton's prejudices, and their different lifestyles.

The losing tribe would have to move to a new campsite.The new Salani then went on to win a closely fought challenge. Jeff tossed Manono a map to their new campsite and they headed out.

Colton told Alicia that he wanted to vote out Christina next, which made her suspicious of his true loyalties. Alicia was fine with one of the women being voted out next as long as it was not her. Later, Colton changed his mind and wanted to target Monica. At the Salani campsite, Jay and Troyzan formed an alliance with Kim. On day 14, Kim went looking for the Hidden Immunity Idol and found it.

The castaway would then bounce a coconut off of a net trampoline to hit one of five targets. The castaways would then race back to the start line where another castaway would take their turn. The first tribe to knock out all five targets would win a trip to a Survivor-style ice cream parlor.Salani continued their winning streak at challenges by winning the Reward Challenge while Manono crumbled due to Christina's lack of effort in the challenge. During the challenge, Colton screamed at Christina and called her an idiot. While Salani was enjoying their reward, Alicia and Colton continued their ridiculing of Christina, with Colton telling Christina that she could enjoy her last two days in the game, quit, or jump in the camp fire. While Alicia, Colton, and Tarzan were off talking, Christina tried to get Jonas and Leif on her side by telling them that Alicia has an alliance with the other women. Alicia came back without Christina noticing and the two had a confrontation over Christina's play in the game.\nDuring the middle of night on day 15, Colton woke up complaining of a severe headache and pain in his right side. Christina tended to Colton, which he took as a ploy to stay in the game. Tarzan, a plastic surgeon, determined that Colton had initial signs of appendicitis, though it could also be something benign. Colton walked out of camp thinking that he was dehydrated. Christina found him curled up on the ground and called the Survivor Medical Team. Ramona, the Medical Team doctor, diagnosed possible appendicitis that required immediate evacuation for further tests. Jeff told Colton the option to give the Hidden Immunity Idol to somebody was completely his. He called the Manono tribe together to say goodbye to Colton. Before Colton left he told his tribe to \"Go get 'em\" and that he was keeping the hidden immunity idol as a souvenir, which angered Alicia. The departure of Colton caused strategy shifts by Alicia and Jonas. Alicia felt that Colton screwed her over by keeping the idol. Jonas thought some of the power in the tribe had shifted to him and that it might be better to vote out Alicia instead of Christina due to Alicia's alliance with the other women.\nOn day 17, treemail stated that both tribes would be going to Tribal Council. While Salani made some wild speculations about what was to occur during a vote at Tribal Council, at Manono, Leif was the swing vote between Alicia and Tarzan voting for Christina or Christina and Jonas voting for Alicia. At Tribal Council, Jeff told the two tribes that Colton had been medically evacuated from the game after being diagnosed with acute appendicitis and taken to a hospital for surgery. The two tribes discussed how Colton's departure affected the game. When Alicia and Tarzan told Salani that Colton kept the hidden immunity idol, the Salani tribe was suspicious that Manono might not be telling the truth. Jeff then shocked the tribes for a second time by telling them to drop their buffs as the tribes were merged.

One at a time, four members of each team would race through an obstacle course of digging and crossing underneath a log and crawling under a wooden rack. They would then dig up a bag of puzzle pieces buried in the sand and race back through the obstacle course. Once all four bags were retrieved, the two remaining team members would use the pieces to assemble a puzzle.

Leif started off first for the blue team and struggled under the log, giving the orange team a huge lead. However, the lead was squandered when Sabrina was slow retrieving the fourth bag of pieces and Michael was able to catch up. The challenge came down to the puzzle assembly stage where Christina and Troyzan faced off against Jonas and Tarzan. Momentum swung back and forth between the two pairs, but Christina and Troyzan managed to pull off the win. After the winning six enjoyed their feast, they read the secret note, which said that there was another Hidden Immunity Idol hidden back at camp. The six agreed to keep the note secret between themselves. Back at camp, Michael told Jonas about Tarzan's plan to reform the original Manono alliance, which was news to Jonas. Jonas confronted Tarzan about it and the two had a vocal argument. Tarzan declared he was dropping his alliance with Jonas and he was dropping out of the tribe. Troyzan woke up early on day 19 to go searching for the new Hidden Immunity Idol and found it.\n\nImmunity Challenge: Each castaway would have to stand on a small wooden log while balancing a ball on a wooden disk.

The post-switch Salani tribe agreed to vote out Jonas for being the biggest threat among the post-switch Manono tribe. Kim told Troyzan that she was thinking of voting out Jonas. Troyzan told Jonas that his name was on the chopping block, which made Jonas start to scramble to swing the vote away from him to Kat. Jonas apologized to Tarzan, which patched up the friction between them and Tarzan resumed his alliance with Jonas. After Chelsea and Tarzan clashed over laundry, Chelsea wanted to shift her alliance's vote from Jonas to Tarzan. At Tribal Council, Jonas tried to deflect votes from himself and on to Michael by openly declaring that he was voting for Michael. Tarzan was not happy that Jonas threw Michael under the bus. Jonas then told Tarzan that they did not have the necessary votes to vote out Kat. Kat asked Tarzan what she had done to deserve the votes and Tarzan said that Jonas was lying. Tarzan stated that the tribe should vote out Jonas and then added, \"If they wanted to vote me off, that's fine! But I'm voting for Jonas tonight for what he did!\" The tribe then discussed the social interaction of Jonas and Tarzan within the tribe.

Tarzan was not picked and sat out the challenge. The challenge was closely fought with the team of Christina, Kim, Leif, Michael, and Sabrina taking the win. During their reward trip, Kim and Sabrina agreed that their alliance with Chelsea could control the game with the other three women by voting out Michael. They would deceive Troyzan into thinking Michael was voting him out. Back at camp, the losing team also talked about whom to vote out next. Troyzan suggested Christina and Jay agreed, while Kat suggested Michael. This made Jay and Troyzan more nervous about an all women alliance. The next day, Tarzan annoyed several members of the tribe when they thought he took a piece of their shelter to use as firewood. Tarzan took Chelsea aside to ask her if she was biased against him because he was a plastic surgeon and she was unhappy with her breast implants. This made Chelsea want to vote out Tarzan as soon as possible, but she knew that the better strategy was to vote out the bigger threats and she thought Tarzan was not a threat.

Troyzan told the tribe that he felt that the bidding was another sign that the game had turned into the rest of the tribe versus him.

Russell found a clue for the hidden immunity idol, and while successful in hiding it, was caught reading the clue by Zane. Russell asserted that anyone looking for the idol would be voted out. The new castaways in Kalabaw immediately targeted Jonathan as their first elimination, while Jonathan began searching for the hidden immunity idol, coming across the clue for it.

She wanted them to abandon the vote against Malcolm and instead vote for Michael as the safe vote. At Tribal Council, Phillip announced that Sherri was part of the Stealth R Us alliance and also said that anybody who is disloyal to the alliance would get voted out. After the votes were cast, Jeff asked if anybody wanted to play a Hidden Immunity Idol. Reynold stood up to play his Idol, but Malcolm told him to \"hold up bro\", and persuaded Reynold that after Phillip's speech about being disloyal, it was obvious the alliance had voted for Malcolm and that Reynold should give Malcolm the Idol. Reynold tossed the Idol over and Malcolm played it. But when the votes were read, the Idol went for naught as the alliance ceded to Andrea's wishes, voting out Michael who became the first member of the Jury."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US26","season":26,"episode_number_overall":366,"episode":10,"episode_title":"Zipping Over the Cuckoo’s Nest","episode_label":"Ep 10","episode_date":"2013-04-17","episode_length":43,"viewers":9990000,"imdb_rating":8.9,"n_ratings":177,"episode_summary":"When the tribe returned to camp after Tribal Council, the Stealth R Us alliance went off to have a private conversation and left Eddie, Malcolm, and Reynold back at the camp. The Stealth R Us alliance agreed they could now freely vote out any of the three as they had no Hidden Immunity Idol, but unbeknownst to them, Malcolm still had one. While off at the lagoon on day 26, Dawn accidentally lost her retainer, which contained her bottom teeth. She yelled for Brenda to come help her and threatened to quit if her teeth were not found. Brenda dove down into the lagoon and found the retainer. The two formed a sympathetic bond after the incident with Brenda saying that she was solidly behind Dawn.\n\nReward Challenge: The tribe would be divided into two teams of five. One at a time, the teams would race through an obstacle course of balance beams, a water slide, and a mud pit. They would then retrieve a bag of balls in the mud and cross a pit full of rice. Once five bags were retrieved, all of the team members would untie the bags and shoot the balls into a basket. The first team to shoot all twelve of their balls into the basket would win a trip to a resort and lunch. Muddy Waters challenge from Survivor: Philippines.At the Reward Challenge, the team of Cochran, Dawn, Erik, Phillip, and Reynold easily defeated the team of Andrea, Brenda, Eddie, Malcolm, and Sherri. The next day, Dawn continued to unravel as she was sure that Andrea would turn against the Stealth R Us alliance and blindside her at the next Tribal Council. Her paranoia made Cochran and Phillip concerned, but things turned around the next day after Dawn got some sleep. The Stealth R Us alliance agreed to split their vote 4–3 against Reynold and Malcolm just in case one of them had a Hidden Immunity Idol.\n\nImmunity Challenge: Competing in two heats of five, the castaways would race across a platform, dive into the ocean, swim under the platform with the aid of a rope, climb back up onto the platform, retrieve a ring and put it on a post on the other side of the platform. They would have to complete two laps of this course. The first two castaways to finish their heat would move on to the final round. In the final round, the castaways would have to complete five laps on the course to win. Keel Hauling challenge from Survivor: Pearl Islands.At the Immunity Challenge, Reynold and Andrea won their heat over Cochran, Dawn, and Sherri. Before the second heat was to be run, Phillip said that he was opting out of the challenge due to the underwater stage of the challenge reminding him of a childhood incident. With the second heat down to four, Malcolm won the heat and Eddie should have joined him, but he missed the post with his second ring, allowing Brenda to join the final round. In the final round, it was neck and neck until the end where Reynold defeated Malcolm. With Reynold's win spoiling the Stealth R Us voting plan, they switched to a vote split between Eddie and Malcolm. But their plans were further spoiled when Malcolm found a Hidden Immunity Idol in full view of Andrea, Dawn, and Eddie. The Stealth R Us alliance decided to stick with the split vote plan. At Tribal Council, Eddie thought he was sure to go home, but the Stealth R Us alliance was stunned when Malcolm pulled out his second Hidden Immunity Idol and gave it to Eddie. There was a lot of whispering among the alliance as they tried to figure out how they were going to vote now that all three outsiders had immunity. Malcolm announced that his \"Three Amigos\" of himself, Eddie, and Reynold were going to vote for Phillip, due to the fact he was sucking the life out of the game, labelling Phillip a \"Fun-sponge\". Phillip told his alliance that they should continue their original split voting plan just in case Eddie and Malcolm did not play their Idols. But when the vote came, they did play them. Everybody in the Stealth R Us alliance except Erik kept to the split vote plan, leaving their votes discarded. The 4 majority votes against Eddie were voided, and Phillip, who had the 2nd highest number of votes, was sent to the jury."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US26","season":26,"episode_number_overall":367,"episode":11,"episode_title":"Come Over to the Dark Side","episode_label":"Ep 11","episode_date":"2013-04-24","episode_length":43,"viewers":10310000,"imdb_rating":7.9,"n_ratings":115,"episode_summary":"With Phillip out of the game, Erik saw his departure as an opportunity to make a move while Cochran and Brenda were shocked and uncertain about their futures.

The next day, Andrea followed Malcolm all day to prevent him from finding the Hidden Immunity Idol.\n\nImmunity Challenge: With one hand, the castaways would hang on to a rope with several knots tied into it. The rope would be tied to one end of a heavy log. The other end of the log would be connected to a pivot point on a platform that the castaways would stand on. The castaways would start at the knot closest to the end of the log. Every five minutes, they would change hands and move one knot further down the rope. This would increase the angle of the log at the pivot point and increase the weight that the castaways would have to hold. The castaway who held on to the rope the longest would win.

When they got to the challenge site, Jeff announced that it would be a combined Reward/Immunity Challenge.\n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: The castaways would stand barefoot on wooden slats on an a-frame that was floating out in the water and try to remain balanced on top of the a-frame. After 15 minutes, the castaways would move up to a second set of slats making balancing more difficult. After another 15 minutes, the castaways would move to the top of the a-frame where they would have to balance until the end of the challenge. The last castaway remaining on the a-frame would win immunity and a reward of information in the game.

Erik and Eddie agreed to jump off together. When the castaways moved up to the second set of slats, Jeff offered three hot dogs and a soda, which Cochran took. Thirty minutes into the challenge, the castaways moved to the top of the a-frame where Dawn, Sherri, and Reynold fell off, leaving Andrea and Brenda to fight it out. They tried to negotiate for one of them to win, but neither wanted to step off. They continued the challenge for three hours when they agreed to share the reward note and to make up their own fourth stage of the challenge by lifting their left foot off the top of the a-frame. Jeff counted down to this new fourth stage and Brenda fell off the top shortly thereafter to give Andrea the win. Back at camp, the reward note turned out to be a clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol. Andrea shared the clue with her whole alliance and they went looking for the idol. Erik found it and handed it over to Andrea. Brenda's determination to stick it out in the challenge made Andrea suspicious of Brenda as she could be a big threat in future challenges. Andrea pushed Cochran, Dawn, and Sherri to blindside Brenda instead of splitting the vote between Eddie and Reynold. But when Tribal Council came, the Favorites did not blindside Brenda and instead sent Reynold to the jury.\nAfter Tribal Council, Andrea was still lobbying hard to Cochran about blindsiding either Brenda or Dawn. Cochran told Brenda and Dawn about Andrea's plan. Brenda immediately turned against Andrea.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would maneuver a buoy through a rope maze to a post. They would then untie a series of knots to release a key. The key would open a chest that contained a set of ladder rung puzzle pieces. The first castaway to assemble their ladder and climb to the top of the tower and raise their flag would win. Great Escape Run challenge from Survivor: Vanuatu.Erik won the Immunity Challenge by a blowout over Brenda. Back at camp, Andrea continued to push for a blindside. Cochran figured out that Andrea wanted to take Eddie to the final three, possibly displacing Cochran in the final three. Suspicious that Andrea was leaving him out of her plans, Cochran talked to Brenda, Dawn, and Sherri about blindsiding Andrea. Just in case Andrea got paranoid at Tribal Council and played the Hidden Immunity Idol, Cochran got his alliance to split the vote between Andrea and Eddie. Andrea told Erik that she would like to go to the final three with him. Erik was not sure if he should join Brenda and Cochran in blindsiding Andrea or joining Andrea in voting out Brenda. At Tribal Council, the timing of a \"big move\" was discussed. When the vote came, Erik made his \"big move\" and decided to vote against Andrea.

They would then assemble the rails into a ladder to play a variation of ladder toss. The first pair to have three bolas on their ladder wins a trip with their loved ones to a boat anchored offshore with a BBQ. Ladder Tree Golf challenge from Survivor: One World.At the Reward Challenge, Brenda's dad Raymond scored the last point to take the win. Jeff called Brenda over and gave her the offer to select one other castaway to join them and Brenda selected Dawn. Jeff then pulled out a second HTC Evo 4G LTE that had a video announcing that, not one, but two loved ones were on the island for the visit. Jeff then told Brenda that she could give up both her and Dawn's visit with their loved ones in exchange for the other four castaways to see their loved ones on the boat. Brenda called the decision a \"no brainer\" and gave up the reward. While the four were enjoying their visit, Dawn was livid that she missed out on her loved ones' visit back at camp because of Brenda. When the castaways returned from the visit, Cochran was concerned that Brenda's gesture would protect her for the rest of the game and would even get her votes at the final Tribal Council.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would stand on a log on the edge of a platform over the water with their arms behind them hanging onto a handle. The handle would be tied to a rope. At regular intervals, Jeff would turn a crank that would uncoil more rope which would lower the castaways closer to the water. The last castaway that hangs onto the handle without falling into the water or stepping off the log would win. Splash Back challenge from Survivor: Nicaragua.At the Immunity Challenge, the challenge came down to Brenda and Dawn. Dawn tried to cut a deal to end the challenge early since Eddie had not won and they would send him to the jury. However, Brenda did not agree to the deal and the challenge continued. Dawn would eventually outlast Brenda to take Individual Immunity.  In addition to being concerned with Brenda as a growing possible jury threat, Cochran was also aware of two separate final 3 deals involving his main ally Dawn- one of Dawn, Erik, Brenda, and another of Dawn, himself, and Sherri, and that Brenda had already begun campaigning with the others to oust him the following vote off should Eddie go this one as planned.  Back at camp, Cochran tried to sell Dawn and Sherri on sending Brenda home. Sherri readily agreed, while Dawn was conflicted on what to do. When the vote came, Dawn followed through with Cochran's plan and voted out Brenda.

Day 37's treemail announced a Reward Challenge with an advantage in the game.\n\nReward Challenge: The castaways would use one hand to hold on to a rope to steady a balancing board. With the other hand, they would build a house of cards with wooden tiles on one end of the balancing board. The first castaway to build a tall enough house of cards to reach the finish mark would win an advantage at the final Immunity Challenge. House of Cards challenge from Survivor: Gabon.At the Reward Challenge, all of the castaway's house of cards collapsed at least twice, until Cochran finally built a house tall enough to reach the mark. Back at camp, Eddie and Sherri agreed to take Cochran to the final three, while Dawn was being paranoid about being voted out. Cochran tried to reassure her that she was not going to be voted out, but he considered voting her out. Day 38's treemail announced the traditional journey honoring the castaways voted out before heading to the final Immunity Challenge.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways would race up a three-story tower to retrieve a bag of puzzle pieces tied to a post and then slide down a water slide. Two more puzzle piece bags would need to be retrieved before the castaways could start on their puzzle. The first castaway to assemble their puzzle would win.Cochran's advantage turned out to be that his puzzle piece bags would not be tied to a post. While the advantage gave Cochran a huge lead into the puzzle assembly stage, he squandered it as the other three caught up to him, but he was able to recover and beat out Dawn for the final Individual Immunity. Back at camp, Cochran's decision came down to either bringing Dawn or Eddie to the final three. Sherri was not deemed any threat at all to win, and was thus completely safe. He chose to take Dawn, fearing Eddie's popularity with many of the male members of the jury, and Eddie became the final member of the jury.\nCochran, Dawn, and Sherri enjoyed the traditional day 39 breakfast. At the Final Tribal Council, the three made their opening statements to the jury. The jury made their statements to the three and questioned the three about their game play. Malcolm told Dawn that she should own up to her game play and asked Cochran what quality he had that allowed him to advance in the game that Malcolm did not have. Eddie asked Sherri if she felt she got carried to the final three to which she replied forcefully she did not only to invoke laughter from several jury members, Dawn about how she could declare herself a strong player when she was seen as weak at camp, and Cochran about how the game had changed him going forward in life and asked if he would ever go on a bro date with the Three Amigos. Phillip \"revoked\" Sherri's membership in Stealth R Us, told Dawn that he would not vote for her, and Cochran that he played a good game. Erik asked Dawn about the damage she caused in her game play. He got into a major argument with Sherri about her game play until Sherri told him to sit down since he would not vote for her anyway. Michael asked Dawn and Cochran why Dawn was perceived as being a villain while Cochran was not. Reynold used his time to tell Dawn he thought she was a fraud and asked what she really thought of him. Andrea asked Cochran to choose an animal that he played the game most like and told Dawn she was proud of her game. Brenda asked Cochran why she should vote for him after he had orchestrated her elimination right after the selfless family visit gift she had given him and the others and he replied that getting rid of her was purely a strong game move and hoped she would respect that as a fellow player, and asked Dawn to remove her dental appliance in front of the jury to show that she would have stayed in the game if she had not recovered it."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US26","season":26,"episode":15,"episode_title":"Reunion","episode_label":"Reunion","episode_date":"2013-05-12","episode_length":33,"viewers":8130000,"imdb_rating":5.7,"n_ratings":113,"episode_summary":"Nearly a year later, the jury vote went unanimously for Cochran and he became the Sole Survivor by a vote of 8–0–0.

The castaways split into their tribes and Jeff sprung a second twist on them that they would immediately vote out a member of their tribe. Tadhana voted out Laura B., while Galang voted out Candice. Jeff then announced that Redemption Island was back in play, but with a twist that the loved one of the castaway could switch places with them.

Brad told her that this was part of the game, but Marissa responded by cursing at him. Suddenly, Colton began to break down crying and told everybody that he wanted to quit. Jeff lambasted Colton for quitting, and even claimed that Colton faked appendicitis during Survivor: One World, making him a two-time quitter. Colton denied this and then departed the game, taking his buff with him.\n\nRedemption Island Challenge: The three castaways would stack wooden blocks like a line of domino tiles while avoiding bars that would topple the tiles that were already stacked.

The new Galang became Kat, Katie, Laura B., Monica, Tina, and Vytas while the new Tadhana became Aras, Caleb, Ciera, Gervase, Hayden, and Tyson.\n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: Working two at a time, the tribe would race out to a cage on the bottom of the ocean, untie knots to release a gate, and retrieve a fish trap. Once three traps were retrieved, two castaways would use puzzle pieces contained in the traps to assemble a puzzle. The first tribe to assemble their puzzle would win immunity and a reward of fixings for a picnic: bread, ham, roast beef, cheese, condiments, and brownies.Laura B. and Tina nearly threw away the challenge when they failed to remember to bring back the first fish trap. Tina nearly redeemed herself when she and Monica made up a lot of ground during the puzzle stage, going so far as thinking they had completed the puzzle twice, but Tadhana persevered and took the win. Back at camp, the women agreed to vote out Vytas, but Kat became irritated at Monica talking strategy too much and approached Tina about voting out Monica instead. Tina became concerned about Kat's loyalty and told Monica and Vytas about Kat's suggestion. Monica confronted Kat about it, but Kat denied everything. At Tribal Council, Kat pleaded for the tribe to keep her in the game and continued to deny that she suggested Monica be voted out. Vytas took the opportunity to deflect the vote away from him by pointing out that he was open and honest with the tribe while Kat was not. When the vote came, the women decided to eliminate Kat and she was sent to Redemption Island."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US27","season":27,"episode_number_overall":377,"episode":7,"episode_title":"Swoop In For The Kill","episode_label":"Ep 7","episode_date":"2013-10-30","episode_length":44,"viewers":9000000,"imdb_rating":7.2,"n_ratings":93,"episode_summary":"At the Redemption Island duel, Kat broke down after she entered the arena.

They would then use the machete to cut a rope which would release a bag of puzzle pieces. The pieces would then have to be assembled into a puzzle the shape of a flame. The first two castaways to solve their puzzle would remain in the game.John cruised to victory, while Laura M. beat out Kat to take second place. John gave the clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol to Monica who continued the practice of burning it. At the Tadhana camp while Aras was away, Tyson organized the ouster of Aras, perceiving him as a threat, and the group of Caleb, Ciera, Gervase, Hayden, and Tyson agreed to go to the final five together.\n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: Four castaways would be chained together by their ankles and have to navigate through an obstacle course to collect bags of balls and chains. Once all the bags were collected, one castaway would assemble the balls and chains into bolas to be used in a game of ladder toss. The first castaway to get three of their bolas onto the ladder would win immunity and a reward of fried chicken, biscuits, corn on the cob, macaroni and cheese, iced tea, and lemonade.The challenge was a close competition with the tribes tied throughout the challenge until Tyson edged out Tina during the ladder toss stage to give Tadhana their third straight victory.

However, the other women did not look kindly upon Laura B. speaking for the girls alliance without consulting them first.

Tyson, who had the Hidden Immunity Idol, did not tell his alliance that the split was unnecessary as he did not want to put a target on himself. Vytas tried to scramble and get the vote to be 4–3 between Katie and himself. At Tribal Council, Vytas and Monica argued about Monica's status in the game. This upset Monica and she changed her vote to Vytas, but he already had the majority of votes and was sent to Redemption Island by a vote of 8–1–1.

Gervase and Tyson became concerned that Monica was being too paranoid about being voted out and was a loose cannon.

Tina recovered from the delay to take second place over Aras, who became the first member of the jury. Vytas gave the clue to the Hidden Immunity Idol to Katie, who did not burn it like past recipients. The clue lead Katie to the spot of the Idol, but she did not know that Tyson already had it.

After Tyson said in his opening statement that he played the game without malice, Katie asked him about the malice in his comment that she was headed to the jury after they drew rocks. Tyson said that that was his one regret in the game and apologized for it. Caleb asked Gervase about his big move in the game and Monica about revealing something about herself. Ciera asked Tyson if he viewed himself as a villain or hero, while she asked Gervase if he ever considered voting out Tyson. Laura M. asked Monica about who she was and about being vulnerable. Tina asked the three to pick one word to describe themselves, with Monica picking \"generous\", Gervase picking \"honorable\", and Tyson picking \"fun-loving\". Hayden asked Tyson if he had the Hidden Immunity Idol when he drew rocks and Monica about what the jury's perception of her was as he felt that nobody really knew her.

Upon arriving at camp, the weakest players had to choose between an extra bag of rice for the tribe or a clue to a hidden immunity idol. Garrett and Morgan chose to look for the Idol, but only Garrett found one, while Trish chose the extra bag of rice.

Garrett was conflicted between voting for J'Tia and David after being selected by David as the weakest tribe member. J'Tia and Tasha agreed to Garrett's plan, but Spencer was paranoid about David potentially having an idol and believed J'Tia was the easier vote. In the end, Spencer sided with Garrett and David was voted out.\nAfter the vote, Kass found herself in a swing vote position, sitting between Spencer and Garrett, and J'Tia and Tasha, eventually allying with the former.

At the Brains camp, Garrett, not wanting anyone to have private talks with each other, began an open discussion with the tribe on whom to send home as he, Kass, and Spencer had agreed on voting out J'Tia. Tasha argued with Garrett, as she wanted to strategize and believed Garrett was not playing the game correctly. When Tasha attempted to privately talk with Kass about voting out Garrett, Garrett and Spencer followed them. With her tribe distracted, J'Tia dumped most of their rice into the fire due to being angry about her tribe wanting to vote her out.

Back at the Brains' camp, they again practiced for a challenge based on the clue they received in tree-mail.\n\nReward challenge: One member of each tribe would act as a caller while two other blindfolded tribe members would navigate the course to retrieve five items and a flag, eventually working with a third blindfolded tribemate to hoist the items up to the caller's platform. The winning tribe would receive three egg-laying hens and a rooster, while the second-place tribe would receive a dozen eggs.Throughout the challenge, the Beauty and Brains tribes were neck-and-neck while Brawn constantly trailed. However, after the Beauty tribe won the challenge, J'Tia of the Brains struggled with hoisting the last item, a flag, resulting in the Brawn tribe catching up and eventually placing second. At the Beauty camp, Jeremiah pulled out a note from their reward in front of the tribe, a hidden immunity idol clue which he read out loud. He proceeded to kill the rooster for the tribe to eat by ripping its head off. At the Brawn's camp, Sarah conspired to get Cliff out of the game due to Tony's lie to Sarah about Cliff targeting her, convincing Woo and Trish to throw the upcoming immunity challenge to do so.\n\nImmunity challenge: All tribe members would take turns diving into the water to retrieve buoys. Once all five are collected, tribe members must throw them into a basket floating in the water. Two tribe members would stay in the water to retrieve any buoys that miss the basket; the person throwing could not throw until they had all un-scored buoys on their platform.The Beauty tribe came in first place. Despite the attempts of several Brawn tribemates to throw the challenge, they finished again in second place, sending the Brains tribe back to Tribal Council. Kass and Tasha weighed their options and considered whether they would vote for Spencer, who was outside their women's alliance but their best challenge competitor, or J'Tia, who was in their alliance but also a challenge liability who had dumped their rice in a prior fit of rage. In the end, Kass and Tasha sided with Spencer, voting J'Tia out."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US28","season":28,"episode_number_overall":388,"episode":4,"episode_title":"Odd One Out","episode_label":"Ep 4","episode_date":"2014-03-19","episode_length":43,"viewers":9460000,"imdb_rating":8,"n_ratings":152,"episode_summary":"The Brains tribe comes back to camp pleased with their decision to vote out J'Tia at Tribal Council.

When the tribes arrived to the challenge, host Jeff Probst told the castaways to drop their buffs, as the three tribes were being redistributed into two tribes. The entire \"Brawn\" tribe, with the exception of Sarah, joined two \"Beauty\" members, LJ and Jefra, to make up the new Solana tribe. Sarah would be joined by the three remaining \"Brains\" (Kass, Spencer, Tasha) and the remaining \"Beauty\" members (Jeremiah, Alexis, Morgan) to make up the new Aparri tribe.\n\nReward challenge: One member of each tribe would hang on to a post. Two members of the opposing tribe would attempt to remove them from the post and drag them across the sand to the finish line. The first tribe to get the member of the other tribe across the finish line would receive one point. The first tribe to score two points wins coffee and pastries.The new Solana tribe won the challenge 2–1 after Cliff proved too heavy for Spencer and Jeremiah to shift. Back at the Solana camp, LJ and Trish formed a bond after both found out they were from Massachusetts. This led to the chagrin of her fellow \"Brawn\" allies, who were concerned that Trish would abandon their alliance. Meanwhile, at Aparri, the former Brains tribe found themselves in a power position after Alexis, Morgan, and Jeremiah each sought out their own new alliance of four with them.\n\nImmunity challenge: Each tribe uses a puzzle log to break through two wooden walls; then, they must turn, pull and push the puzzle log to navigate a maze that is worked into the surface of the log. Once the log is cleared from the maze station, the first tribe to hit a gong at the end of the course wins immunity.At the immunity challenge, the Aparri members overcame Solana's early lead to win immunity. While most of the original Brawn tribe wanted to vote out LJ, Trish decided to join LJ and Jefra in voting out Cliff. She encouraged Tony to join her newly formed alliance and eliminate former NBA player and potential post-merge challenge threat Cliff, though Tony appeared hesitant. LJ was prepared to play his hidden immunity idol, but chose not to do so.

Soon after, Jeff stopped by Solana's camp to inform the tribe of Lindsey's decision to leave.\n\nReward challenge: Facing off one against one in a fenced off circle, a castaway from each tribe would hold a wooden idol on top of a platform that they would hold in one hand. They would use the other free hand to attempt to knock their opponent's idol off the platform. The castaway whose idol hit the ground last would score one point for their tribe. First tribe to four points would get to raid the other tribe's camp.The Solana tribe won the reward challenge and selected Tony and Woo to go to the Aparri camp and pick two items they'd like to take. Tony and Woo opened two notes given to them at the challenge: one informing them of the items they could choose from and the second being a clue to the hidden immunity idol at their own camp. Instead, Tony pretended they were given a clue to assign to a member of the Aparri tribe, giving it to Jeremiah in an attempt to make him a target. Jeremiah later realized that the clue was the same one he had received while on the original Solana tribe and therefore useless to him at Aparri, though Spencer and Alexis appeared skeptical about that claim.\n\nImmunity challenge: Each tribe would build a staircase out of wooden poles, then climb it to reach a bamboo maze. Upon exiting the maze and sliding down a bamboo slide, one tribe member would maneuver a key through a rope obstacle, using the key to unlock a machete to release puzzle pieces. Two more tribe members would then solve a puzzle to reveal the solution to a combination lock. The first tribe to unlock their flag would win immunity.Despite quickly falling behind on the staircase portion, the Solana tribe came out victorious due to LJ's and Woo's puzzle-solving skills, and won immunity. At the Aparri camp, Alexis attempted to convince the rest of the tribe to vote out Jeremiah, believing him to be the most likely person to turn against them after the merge. Spencer saw through Alexis's scheming and felt she came across as fake, along with the worry that Alexis would rejoin former Beauty allies LJ and Jefra at the merge.

Upon arrival, the merge was confirmed and they were informed of a new hidden immunity idol with unspecified \"different powers.\" With the new tribe totaling 11 members, each former tribe attempted to solidify their numbers ahead of the first individual immunity challenge. Despite some tension between Kass and Sarah, the former Aparri tribe had a one-member numerical advantage, so Tony attempted to get his former Brawn ally Sarah to flip to the Solana alliance.\n\nImmunity challenge: The castaways would stand barefoot on wooden slats on an a-frame that was floating in the water and try to remain balanced. After 15 minutes, the castaways would move up to a second set of slats, closer together. After another 15 minutes, the castaways would move to the top of the a-frame where they would have to balance until one person remained, who would then win immunity.Woo held out against Tony to win immunity. Sarah decided to remain loyal to the former Aparri tribe, but encouraged her allies to vote for Tony. When questioned by Tony about her allegiances, Sarah remained non-committal and he realized she would not turn to their side. Instead, Trish—who had overheard an argument between Sarah and Kass—questioned Kass about her role in the alliance and asked who from the former Aparri she would most likely vote for. When she answered with Sarah, Trish told her that the former Solana tribe would vote for Sarah per Kass' request, leaving the option for Kass to vote with them on the table.\nAt Tribal Council, Tony revealed his hidden immunity idol and announced that it was a \"community idol\" to help any member of his alliance. Spencer then publicly announced for the Aparri alliance to switch their votes to \"the other one.\" Thinking that \"the other one\" was LJ, Tony played his idol on him. LJ repaid the favor by playing his own idol on Tony, ensuring that both men were safe from the vote. \"The other one\" turned out to be Jefra, wasting both idols.

Once on land, the teams would untie knots on a treasure chest and then carry it to a tower, climb up the tower individually and pull the chest up. Two members from each team would then solve a puzzle. The first team to solve the puzzle would be taken to an Outback Steakhouse and enjoy a feast including steak, baked potatoes, and s'mores.The team of Jefra, Jeremiah, LJ, Morgan, and Spencer won the reward challenge. During their reward, Spencer found a clue to a hidden immunity idol in his napkin and slipped it into his pocket without anyone noticing. Back at camp, Spencer went off in the rain to read his clue and look for the idol, only to be followed by Woo. After the two met up and Spencer began walking away, Woo picked up the pants Spencer had left behind and discovered his idol clue when it fell out of the pants. Woo ran back to camp with the clue and informed everyone about Spencer's discovery, prompting everyone to begin searching for the idol. Eventually, Spencer found the idol when Kass—who was supposed to be watching him—briefly turned her back.

At Callao Cave, Jeremiah, Spencer, and Tasha tried to convince Jefra to align with them.

At Hunahpu, Jeremy apologized for sending Keith to Exile Island, and promised to make it up to him. At Coyopa, Dale became wary of Nadiya for her backstabbing gameplay on The Amazing Race. The tribe was divided by gender lines, with Josh, perceived by Nadiya as \"one of the girls\" for being gay, caught in the middle. He was approached by Baylor, who decided to stick with him and not necessarily the other women. The women decided to target Dale due to his age, and the men targeted Nadiya. At Tribal Council, Josh voted for Baylor while Baylor flipped on the girls, joining the other four men to form a majority of five to send Nadiya out of the game."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US29","season":29,"episode_number_overall":399,"episode":2,"episode_title":"Method To This Madness","episode_label":"Ep 2","episode_date":"2014-10-01","episode_length":43,"viewers":9490000,"imdb_rating":7.5,"n_ratings":104,"episode_summary":"As the Coyopa tribe returned to camp after voting out Nadiya, Josh explained to Baylor that he voted for her to remove suspicion that the two were working together, although Baylor still felt scared by Josh's move.

Before the reward challenge, John beat Reed in rock-paper-scissors, giving Coyopa the right to pick the representatives for the duel; John volunteered for Coyopa, setting a matchup between himself and his girlfriend, Julie.\n\nReward challenge: The duelists would balance a ball on a disc attached to a pole while maneuvering a series of obstacles, returning to the start if they drop their ball. Then, they will roll three balls to land in a series of holes. The first duelist to land all three balls in the holes would receive fishing gear for their tribe.Julie won in a blowout victory, and chose Jeremy to join John on Exile Island. Before the tribes left, Hunahpu attempted to bargain with Jeff for a new flint, offering their remaining supply of beans for trade. Jeff vocalized that the trade was poorly planned and unbalanced, in turn putting Hunahpu's newly-won fishing gear on the line, which the tribe reluctantly accepted as trade. At Coyopa, with John exiled, the tribe discussed his past as a baseball player, and Dale brought up the controversial statements he made about minority groups. At Exile Island, Jeremy picked the urn with the clue, but shared it with John under the proviso that they protect each other's loved ones upon returning to camp.\n\nImmunity challenge: Facing off one-on-one, the castaways would battle sumo style using padded bags to try to knock their opponent off a platform and into the ocean to score a point for their tribe.

Upon returning to camp, John attempted to secure an alliance with Val, however she lied to him, claiming that she had two hidden idols that would keep herself and Jaclyn safe that night. John decided to look for the hidden immunity idol using Jeremy's information, which he found. John, still believing in Val's idols, organized a split vote between Val and Baylor with three men joining Jaclyn and Val in voting for Baylor, deemed untrustworthy after voting out Nadiya, and two men joining an unsuspecting Baylor in voting for Val to flush one of Val's idols. At Tribal Council, Val and Jaclyn attempted to rally support against Baylor, publicly accusing her of playing both sides, while Val was called out for claiming to have two idols in hopes she would play one. The split vote plan went awry after Josh switched his vote to Val, resulting in a tie between her and Baylor.

The first duelist to stack six of the squares onto the other side of the beam would win a tarp, a hammock, a mattress, pillows and blankets for their tribe, with the option of trading the reward for fishing gear.Coyopa won rock-paper-scissors to choose their duelist; Wes volunteered to compete, thinking he could beat his father, Keith. Wes' assumption was correct, winning the challenge and sending Josh to Exile Island with Keith; Coyopa, with their first challenge victory under their belt, chose the fishing gear over comfort. Back at Hunahpu, a scorned Jeremy outed John's past baseball career and derogatory remarks against minority groups, alienating John's girlfriend Julie from the tribe. At Exile Island, Keith shared the idol clue with Josh, and the two bonded despite their vastly different ways of life. At Coyopa, John effectively used the fishing gear to provide for his tribe, but Baylor still attempted to convince the majority alliance to turn against him.\n\nImmunity challenge: Two members of each tribe would be tethered together and race through a wooden obstacle course to retrieve a ball, and then attempt to shoot it into a basket. The first tribe to win three rounds would win immunity.With the score tied 2-2, Jon and Natalie edged out Wes and Alec to win Hunahpu's third consecutive immunity challenge. When Natalie began trash-talking Coyopa after her tribe's victory, John Rocker reacted by mocking her in front of everyone. Natalie called Coyopa to rally against Rocker, calling him a racist and a bigot, and he responded by telling her, \"if you were a man, I'd knock your teeth out.\" Back at camp, John attempted to throw Baylor and Jaclyn off his scent by claiming he was going to blindside Dale while, in actuality, he and the other men would send Baylor home.

Drew attempted to trade the old flint with Jeff to get the fishing gear back while the rest of his tribe appeared embarrassed and took no part in the negotiation, but Jeff quickly shut it down.\n\nReward challenge: The duelist would use a grappling hook to grab three bags of balls, and then use a catapult to launch the balls into five baskets. The first duelist to get a ball into each basket would win either a feast of sausages, popcorn, and s'mores for their tribe, or a tarp, a hammock, a mattress, pillows and blankets.Jon volunteered for Hunahpu after they won rock-paper-scissors to choose their duelist, pitting him against his girlfriend, Jaclyn. Jon narrowly won the challenge, and Drew volunteered to go to Exile Island with Jaclyn; Hunahpu chose the comfort items over the feast. At Exile Island, Drew revealed to Jaclyn that he planned to throw the next immunity challenge to get rid of untrustworthy players on Hunahpu. At Hunahpu, Keith went searching for the hidden immunity idol; as he was unsuccessful, he assumed that Jeremy—the only other person from his tribe to have been to Exile Island—had found it, and voiced his suspicions to his tribemates. Reed ratted Keith out to Jeremy, while Keith eventually found the idol.\n\nImmunity challenge: Four tribemates would swim out to retrieve rings tethered in the water. Once the four rings were retrieved, the other two tribemates would toss the rings onto a post. The first tribe to land all four rings would win immunity.While the tribes were neck-and-neck, Drew intentionally botched the ring tossing to give Coyopa their first immunity challenge win. Back at camp, Jon proposed getting rid of the players without loved ones, for fear that they would outnumber the couples at the merge, with Julie as his first target. Drew vehemently proposed getting rid of Kelley, whom he perceived as the strongest manipulator of a potential women's alliance, while Jeremy tried to get support to vote Keith out. Despite being outnumbered by the men, the four women banded together to take advantage of the men's disorganization, and targeted Drew.

The new Hunahpu tribe lamented their nearly-depleted supply of rice, while Natalie and Jeremy were afraid that they would be in the minority against the three former Coyopa members—Alec, Josh, and Wes—and Reed, Josh's boyfriend, so they attempted to sway Alec to form an alliance of those whose loved ones had already been voted out. At Coyopa, Missy and Dale quickly butted heads over rice portioning, and Missy thought about targeting Dale after hearing that he had tried to vote out her daughter, Baylor. Before the immunity challenge, a starving Hunahpu once again considered bartering with Jeff, this time for more rice.\n\nImmunity challenge: The tribes would race to dig up a bag containing two keys, then crawl through mud and use the keys to open the gate.

At the reward duel, since there were no intact pairs on opposite tribes who had yet to duel, the tribes were tasked to send their strongest competitor; Hunahpu sent Reed, while Coyopa chose Baylor.\n\nReward challenge: The blindfolded duelist would race through a series of obstacles to a station where they would tactility study a mask. They would then untie three bags of puzzle pieces, one at a time, and race back through the obstacles to a second station, where they would blindly recreate the mask with the puzzle pieces; while all of the pieces fit, only seven were colored and shaped correctly. The first duelist to correctly recreate the mask at the second station would win a grill, charcoal and skewers of meat and vegetables for their tribe.Reed handily defeated Baylor to win the challenge for Hunahpu; while he initially chose to send Julie to Exile Island with Baylor, Natalie volunteered. Back at Coyopa, Jon told Missy and Baylor about Dale's idol, thrusting a backup target on Keith. At Exile Island, Baylor shared the idol clue with Natalie. At Hunahpu, despite enjoying the reward, the tribe was still upset with the rice trade, and were forced to brave out a storm that night without their tarp, with Julie in particular having a very hard time.\n\nImmunity challenge: The tribes would race over a tall wall and work together to push a wooden cube toward a series of posts.

Baylor suggested to Missy, Jon, and Jaclyn that they split their votes between Keith and Dale out of fear of Dale's idol.

Later that day, the tribes merged and enjoyed a commemorative feast. In the ensuing strategic scramble, Jeremy reconnected with Missy, and added her, Baylor, Jon, and Jaclyn to his alliance, while Keith aligned with his son Wes and his alliance.\nThe next morning, Josh continued to consolidate his alliance and target Jeremy. Josh tried to realign with Baylor but, despite Josh’s earlier protection of her, Baylor found herself torn between her allegiances with Josh and her mother, Missy; while Baylor voiced her uneasiness in betraying Josh, Missy told Baylor to not let her emotions rule her. Josh, noting that Baylor would be impossible to control with Missy around, decided to cajole Jon and Jaclyn instead. The tribe noticed that some of the leftover trail mix from the merge feast was missing, and started searching everyone's bags for it. Jon found it in Julie's bag, and the tribe ate it out of anger for her selfishness; when Julie returned from a walk, the tribe gave her the cold shoulder.\n\nImmunity challenge: The castaways would balance a ball on a disc attached to knotted ropes, moving their hands up a knot every few minutes to increase difficulty.

Upon returning to camp, Julie overheard Alec making fun of her for taking the trail mix, and later told Missy that she was considering quitting due to missing her eliminated boyfriend John and feeling alone; while Missy implored Julie to stay in the game for at least one more night, Julie perceived that Missy's support was only because she needed Julie to vote with their alliance that night, and felt further alienated. After weighing offers from both sides, Jon and Jaclyn decided to join Josh’s couple-heavy alliance and blindside Jeremy, however, Julie decided to officially quit the game after a quick talk with Jeff outside camp.

Back at camp, Josh again pleaded with Baylor for her vote but, even after reminders of his protection of her on the old Coyopa tribe, she refused to vote with Josh's alliance. On Exile Island, Jon found a new hidden immunity idol after receiving a clue.

On the yacht, Jon and Jaclyn were thankful for Jeremy and Natalie's sacrifice, but understood that it was still a game move.

They then would assemble a bridge by placing wooden poles in open slots across two beams. Once across, they would throw sandbags to knock down ten stacked circular blocks. The first castaway to finish would win an advantage in the next immunity challenge.Due to Missy's injury, she sat out of the challenge. Keith maintained his lead over Natalie to win the reward and exile Jaclyn. Back at camp, Keith used his advantage — access to a practice table for the upcoming challenge—and practiced as long as he could. Before the immunity challenge, Missy and Baylor further discussed sticking with Natalie, as she was likely to survive the next Tribal Council with her hidden immunity idol. Natalie, however, conspired with Keith and Jaclyn to break up the mother and daughter pair as the last remaining set of loved ones.\n\nImmunity challenge: Each castaway would maneuver a ball across a series of obstacles on a table course. The first castaway to transfer three balls to the other side of the table would win immunity.Having spent hours practicing, Keith was able to win the challenge before the others could even get a single ball across. Back at camp, Jaclyn informed Natalie of her plan to vote for either Missy or Baylor, and promised she would take Natalie to the end, while Baylor asked Natalie to play her idol on Missy to be safe. At Tribal Council, Natalie decided to play her idol on Jaclyn after confirming with her that Jaclyn had followed through with their plan. The three votes against Jaclyn were negated, and Baylor was sent to the jury, leaving no pairs remaining.\nHaving betrayed Missy and eliminated her daughter, Natalie made sure that Missy was not angry with her; Missy understood that it was just a game, and that Natalie did what she had to do to further herself. Natalie then confirmed with the other women that Keith was still the next to go.\n\nImmunity challenge: The castaways would race down a tower and maneuver through obstacles to retrieve bags of puzzle pieces; once all five bags of pieces were retrieved, the castaways would use them to solve a puzzle of the season's logo. However, three pieces would be missing; the castaway would then head down the tower, find the numbers that correspond to the missing shapes, and use the numbers to open a combination lock. The first player to unlock their flag would win immunity.With Missy sitting out of the challenge, Natalie and Jaclyn fought hard to prevent Keith from winning immunity. While Keith and Natalie were neck-and-neck in retrieving their puzzle pieces, an exhausted Jaclyn was able to pull from behind to finish the puzzle and open the lock to win immunity. While Keith targeted Missy, Natalie was afraid that — after making big moves at the last two Tribal Councils — she would be an easy target. Missy and Jaclyn indeed discussed eliminating Natalie, with Jaclyn conceding that that's what Jon would do if he were still in the game. At Tribal Council, while Natalie admitted that she had a chance to win, and thus was a threat to the others, the women stuck to their initial plan and Keith became the final member of the jury.\nAt the final Tribal Council, Missy stressed the importance of loyalty in her game despite turning on Jon, Jaclyn discussed her diagnosis of MRKH syndrome, which prohibits her from having children, and how she has been persevering despite it, while Natalie explained that she managed to persist and make big moves despite her twin sister being voted out first.

At camp, the pairs were given a choice between a big bag of beans or a smaller bag of beans and a clue to the hidden immunity idol. Only Joaquin and So decided to take the clue, subsequently lying to their tribe about their decision, raising suspicion. Dan and Mike told their Blue Collar tribe the truth about their decision, though Sierra was skeptical. At the No Collar camp, Vince bonded with Jenn over their mutual outlook on life but bickered with Joe over how to build the shelter. \nThe following day, the Blue Collar tribe also argued about the shelter, with Dan complaining over his tribemates' choices; Rodney and the women agreed that Dan would be an easy target to eliminate first, but Dan found an ally in Mike. At the No Collar camp, Joe earned his tribe mates' admiration, particularly Jenn's, by making fire without flint. Vince took Jenn aside to make sure that she was still loyal to him, causing Jenn to doubt whether Vince was a viable alliance partner. At the White Collar camp, Carolyn suspected So was looking for the hidden immunity idol, but successfully found it herself, citing knowledge of past seasons' hiding spots as her guide.\n\nReward/immunity challenge: The tribes raced down a platform through a pile of hay and high stepped through an obstacle. Each tribe had to unlock a ladder; to release it, they chose to either untie a series of knots or unlock three locks with a ring of 20 keys. The tribes then used the ladder to navigate a platform and then retrieve one of three puzzles: an easy 50-piece puzzle, a medium-difficulty 10-piece puzzle, or a very difficult five-piece puzzle. The first tribe to complete their puzzle won immunity and a fire-making kit, while the second-place tribe received immunity and flint.White Collar and No Collar were neck-and-neck until Shirin from the White Collar tribe struggled on the 50-piece puzzle; the other two tribes found success with the 10-piece puzzle and won immunity. While Shirin seemed to be an easy target for the White Collar tribe's first vote, So decided to target Carolyn for not stepping up to either the ladder releasing or puzzle solving tasks during the challenge; to save herself, Carolyn told Tyler about her idol. So and Joaquin believed that they were in an alliance with Max and Tyler, but Max's true loyalty was with Shirin and Carolyn, who attempted to get Tyler to join them in voting off So. At Tribal Council, Shirin called Joaquin and So out for their lie regarding the clue to the hidden immunity idol, while So admitted that Carolyn was her target, which prompted a heated debate between the two.

On the No Collar tribe, Hali and Jenn's attempts to get to know Nina were complicated by Nina's deafness, and tensions increased when Hali and Jenn decided to go skinny dipping without asking her, leading to a public outburst from Nina out of frustration.\nWhile the Blue Collar tribe played makeshift basketball around camp, Mike insisted that the tribe continue to work, annoying Rodney in the process. At the No Collar camp, Vince voiced his frustrations about Joe to Nina, and Vince's attempt to talk to Joe about his behavior around camp only served to further their enmity. With an alliance formed between younger tribe members Hali, Jenn, and Joe, Vince, Nina, and Will considered sticking together.\n\nReward/immunity challenge: One tribe member at a time manoeuvred a buoy through a series of obstacles in the water. Once all five competing tribe members had retrieved their buoys, one member attempted to toss them into a cylinder basket. The first tribe that shot all five buoys into the basket won immunity and a large fishing kit, while the second tribe won immunity and a smaller fishing kit.After No Collar's Will struggled in the water, the other two tribes pulled ahead to win immunity. Back at camp, Vince told Nina that he was worried about Will's health due to his weight and asthma, but was considering blindsiding Joe, as voting Will would keep the tribe strong but put the younger alliance in power. The younger alliance tried to recruit Will to split the vote against Nina and Vince—out of fear for a hidden immunity idol—to ultimately eliminate Nina on the re-vote; Will was hesitant to vote against Nina, his closest ally. Will told Nina and Vince about the vote-splitting, and they decided to target Jenn due to her perceived untrustworthiness and Joe's challenge prowess. However, Nina later told Will that Vince was concerned for Will's health, and had considered voting him out.

The next day, the White Collar tribe sans Carolyn looked for the hidden immunity idol, but were unsuccessful as Carolyn had already found it. Shirin proposed a truce, but Joaquin didn't trust her and continued searching with Tyler; though Tyler knew that Carolyn had the idol and Joaquin was on the outs, he continued searching anyway to keep Joaquin's trust as he considered betraying Shirin for her behavior. At the Blue Collar camp, Dan's attempts to be funny upset Rodney after Dan jokingly insulted his mother. Later, Mike voiced his frustrations with his tribe-mates' work ethic, provoking arguments between him and Rodney, Sierra, and Lindsey, the last of whom insulted Mike's religious views.\n\nReward/immunity challenge: Each tribe carried a large bucket with holes to a water tower, filled the bucket, and raced back to a barrel to dump out the water. The first tribe to fill up their barrel won immunity and lounge chairs, blankets, pillows, and a tarp. The second tribe won immunity and a tarp.The No Collar tribe fell behind quickly, which prompted Joe to send Nina back from the water tower to the barrel; the strategy proved ineffective, and they lost their second consecutive challenge. Back at camp, Joe apologized to Nina for implementing the faulty strategy and assuming she would slow the tribe down. Will and Nina both campaigned to vote the other out. Though the original plan was to eliminate Nina, Hali and Jenn considered voting Will out instead after he had proven himself unpredictable by voting Vince out. At Tribal Council, Nina claimed that her tribe perceived that she was weak because of her deafness, though the tribe argued that wasn't the case. When Will discussed his poor challenge performance, Nina took the opportunity to openly campaign against him. She then discussed her previous white collar background and how she felt she had been placed on the wrong tribe.

The winning tribe received three egg-laying hens and a rooster, while the second-place tribe received ten eggs.During the challenge, the Blue Collar tribe's platform dropped on Kelly's forehead; after a brief medical examination she was cleared to continue in the challenge. The No Collar tribe finished in first place while the White Collar tribe took second. The victorious No Collar tribe celebrated Will's birthday by eating one of their chickens from the reward. Jenn, a vegetarian, felt uncomfortable with the killing and roasting; she went searching for the hidden immunity idol, which she found, while the tribe feasted. At the Blue Collar camp, Kelly received six stitches from her injury at the challenge, but her bravery throughout the ordeal earned Mike's respect, and the two affirmed their alliance. Rodney's remarks that women should hold themselves to a higher standard than men caused a heated argument between him and Lindsey. At the White Collar camp, Shirin continued to alienate her tribe-mates with her behavior, which caused Carolyn to consider betraying Shirin and her closest ally, Max. \n\nImmunity challenge: Each tribe-mate was tethered to a rope; one at a time, they navigated through a series of obstacles; once all four tribe-mates completed the course, they grabbed a bag of balls, and used them to navigate a vertical maze. The first two tribes to get all three balls to the top of the maze won immunity.All three tribes were neck-and-neck throughout the challenge, but the No Collar and White Collar tribes narrowly won, sending Blue Collar to their first Tribal Council.

The first tribe to reach five points won a box of kitchen supplies, including pots, pans, oils spices, and sausages, and all of the rewards from the now-abandoned White Collar camp.The new Escameca tribe quickly won the challenge, five points to Nagarote's two. At the Nagarote camp, the former No Collar and White Collar tribe-mates, three people apiece, vied for Kelly's vote; the No Collar alliance took a more laid-back approach, while former White Collar Shirin acted quickly. Later, Shirin's behavior got on her new tribe-mates' nerves. Max was stung on both feet by a stingray; after putting his wart-covered feet in the tribe's cooking pot on Jenn's advice, he was perceived as selfish. At Escameca, Dan, Mike, and Rodney realized that Sierra had all the reason to abandon them for their new tribe-mates, and attempted to bring her back into their fold.

Upon exiting the maze and sliding down bamboo, one tribe member maneuvered a key through a rope obstacle and then used it to unlock a machete to release puzzle pieces. Two more tribe members then solved a puzzle to reveal the solution to a combination lock. The first tribe that unlocked their flag won a day trip to a spa. Styx challenge from Cagayan.Abi-Maria was not chosen to compete. The team of Jeremy, Keith, Wentworth, Kelly Wiglesworth, and Kimmi struggled assembling their poles, allowing Ciera, Joe, Spencer, Stephen, and Tasha to coast to an easy victory. Ciera tried to convince the others on the reward trip to make a move against Jeremy but, back at camp, Jeremy found a clue to another hidden immunity idol. The clue told Jeremy the idol's exact location outside of camp, but required him to go there that night, after the challenge winners returned from the spa; he did so, and found his second hidden idol. Stephen later noted the bond between Joe and Wiglesworth, and conspired with the Witches to vote together at the upcoming Tribal Council to split them up.\n\nImmunity challenge: The castaways stood barefoot on wooden slats on an a-frame, floating in the water, trying to remain balanced.

Stephen's advantage was that he had the right to “steal” another player's vote at any Tribal Council until the final five,[35] prohibiting them from voting, while allowing him to vote twice.

The Healers and Heroes came in first and second respectively, while the Hustlers went completely off course. The Healers tribe had no problem creating fire with their kit, while Jessica developed an attraction towards Cole. The next day, Mike decided to look for a hidden immunity idol, but Joe became suspicious of Mike's absence and confronted him over what he had been doing. At the Heroes tribe, a majority formed among Alan, Ashley, Ben, and JP, but Alan was at odds with Ashley and JP over their closer bond, calling them a \"power couple\" before accusing JP of having an idol. At the Hustlers tribe, Patrick and Ali aligned, while Ryan learned his \"secret advantage\" was a \"super immunity idol\" that could be played after the votes were read. This advantage could only be used at the first Tribal Council, meaning he would have to anonymously will it to someone on the losing tribe if his tribe won immunity. Ryan informed Devon of this advantage and offered to use it on him in the event they end up at Tribal Council, forming a final 2 deal.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways will race up a cargo net to the top of a tower.

The last tribe will be left with the maze that remains. Next, they will work together as a tribe to get their maze to the top of an even taller tower. Once at the top of the tower, two players from each tribe will maneuver three balls through their maze. The first two tribes to finish win immunity.After Ben and Chrissy's poor maneuvering of the maze, the Healers and Hustlers won immunity, sending the Heroes to Tribal Council and forcing Ryan to will his advantage. At the Heroes camp, the majority decided to send Katrina home over Chrissy, but the tension between Alan and Ashley still lingered. Alan later approached Chrissy and Katrina with a plan to vote out Ashley, and tried to convince Ben to join them. Ben tried to assure Alan that Ashley and JP were loyal to them, but Alan was still paranoid about the potential couple. Before Tribal Council, Chrissy learned that she had been given the secret advantage.\nAt Tribal Council, Ashley called Alan out for his irrational behavior, while Alan openly stated that he did not trust Ashley or JP and warned his other tribemates about them becoming a power couple.

After misinterpreting the clue as pointing towards the fishing raft, Joe had Cole help him find the idol. At the Heroes camp, JP established himself as the tribe’s provider to keep the target off his back, while Chrissy formed an alliance with Ben after weighing her options.

She told Cole and Mike to build trust and keep the original Healers tribe intact, but Cole used the information to gain trust with Ben and Lauren, confusing the latter as to why he would tell her about it.

At the new Naviti tribe, Chris tried to rally votes against Domenick, but his attitude set Angela and Libby off. Morgan was suspicious of Chris, and she and Libby aligned. At the new Malolo tribe, Bradley's complaining over Malolo's shelter got on some people's nerves, while Michael and Brendan found one of James's idols from China.\n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: Castaways will need to jump between three sets of raised ramps to a sand pit, where they will need to dig out a heavy ladder. Using the ladder, one tribe member will need to retrieve a monkey's fist on top of a tripod, which they will use to climb the first ramp of the tower. The tribe will then need to hoist each other to the top of a second ramp, where two members will need to solve a tiki head puzzle to win immunity and a tarp.Malolo won the challenge; after they couldn't decide who from Naviti to send to Ghost Island, the Naviti members drew rocks to determine who would go. Chris drew the odd-colored rock, foiling Domenick's plan to blindside him. On Ghost Island, the urn Chris smashed was empty, and he opened up about his mother's struggle with multiple sclerosis. At Naviti, Angela wanted to stay strong with her old tribe members and vote out Libby, but Wendell saw Angela as Chris's \"right-hand man\", and started to rally votes against her. Meanwhile, Domenick showed his fake idol to the former Malolo members to build trust with them, but James didn't believe him and, seeing an opportunity to control the vote as Naviti was set to turn on Angela, pitched an idea to the other former Malolo members to vote out Morgan, which Libby objected to.

At least one castaway must be touching both the ring and their tribe's flagpole simultaneously to score a point for their tribe. The first tribe to score three points wins a feast of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with ice cold milk.Before the challenge, Jeff revealed that someone would visit Ghost Island and return before the immunity challenge, meaning they would also be vulnerable if their tribe were to visit Tribal Council. Naviti won the challenge and immediately chose to have Malolo draw rocks; Kellyn was sent to Ghost Island immediately after she explained that being separated was her worst Survivor fear. Although the urn she smashed allowed her to play the game of chance, she decided not to risk losing her vote. At Naviti, a confused and angry Chris learned from Angela about Domenick's alliance's betrayal; they planned on aligning with the former Malolo members, but Donathan talked to Wendell about working together and Laurel talked to Domenick, who revealed his idol to her.\n\nImmunity Challenge: Castaways will have to swim out to a bamboo cage, hop over and dive in the cage to release a door underwater.

Using the balls in the chest, they will need to get all five of them on top of a narrow perch to win immunity.Although Malolo had a huge lead through the chest-carrying stage, Naviti pulled off a massive comeback and edged out Malolo during the ball-tossing stage to win immunity, largely thanks to Chris's efforts. Stephanie was put off by Bradley's arrogant attitude and was even more offended when Bradley flat-out told her there was no hope for her alliance. The Naviti majority wanted to weaken the other alliance and Chelsea proposed voting out Michael or Brendan; the Naviti alliance proceeded to debate on which of the two to vote out. Michael revealed his idol to Stephanie and Jenna, which gave the alliance hope. At Tribal Council, Brendan declared Sebastian and Chelsea to be on the bottom of an alliance led by Bradley, and Michael encouraged them to flip after he pulled out his idol, falsely calling it a double immunity idol in an attempt to throw the opposing alliance off their game.

Grabbing only one satchel, the runner will get on the boogie board in the water, where their tribemates will have to reel them onto shore. Once the runner returns to shore, another person goes out. Once they have all four satchels, tribes will make their way to the finish deck, where they will use the numbered tiles to solve a combination lock, obtaining a key, which unlocks the tribe's sliding puzzle. The first tribe to finish their puzzle wins immunity.Naviti won immunity yet again. The Naviti majority debated on who to vote out; they decided that Jenna was an easy, safe vote, but Michael was the biggest threat. Jenna flirted with Sebastian to save herself, while Michael pled his case to Bradley, saying they needed him for the challenges. Desiree searched Stephanie's bag for an advantage and didn't find one.

The first tribe to assemble their puzzle correctly won immunity and flint.Vokai ran away with the victory during the puzzle portion of the challenge. Jeff had a Lairo member randomly draw the name of a tribemate to be sent to the Island of the Idols; Elaine drew Elizabeth's name. Jeff also said Elizabeth would return in time for Tribal Council that night. At the Island of the Idols, an excited Elizabeth was greeted by Boston Rob and Sandra, who taught her how to make fire. Elizabeth made fire after struggling, then accepted an offer to take on Rob in a fire-making challenge for an idol good at the next two Tribal Councils. Elizabeth lost the duel and therefore, her vote as well. Before she left, Rob and Sandra told her to randomly draw a Vokai member's name (which remained unrevealed) to be the next visitor to the Island of the Idols.\nBack at camp, Chelsea conferred with Elaine, Tom, and Vince, who targeted Ronnie. Elaine was targeted by some of the other tribe members, but after pledging her loyalty to them, Aaron targeted Vince instead. Elizabeth returned to camp and withheld the information about Rob and Sandra, as well as the fact that she lost her vote. At Tribal Council, Rob and Sandra watched the proceedings from a concealed alcove; Elaine continued to plead her case, while Ronnie made a case for tribe strength.

The first two days were relaxing for Dakal, with Sandra and Tony patching things up from Game Changers, and Yul & Sophie gathering other first-time returners Wendell and Nick into a group.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The tribes must paddle out from shore to retrieve a bag full of numbers, before returning to a series of obstacles in the water (first leaping off boxed stairs into the water, then climbing over a rolling pillar, and lastly getting over a cargo net incline before reaching the shore). At their tribe's station, one member must unlock three rings using the 3 two-digit numbers in their bag. Afterward, two members must toss their rings to hang on paddles. The first tribe to successfully toss all 3 rings onto their paddles wins immunity. Blue Lagoon Bustle challenge from Blood vs. Water and Game Changers.Sele claimed victory at the challenge, which also gave Denise her first-ever win at a tribal immunity challenge. At Dakal on Day 3, Yul and Sophie started recruiting the former Game Changers trio (Sandra, Sarah, and Tony) to target Amber, Kim, and Tyson. Sandra discovered an offer for an idol had appeared in her belongings for a fire token, which she accepted, correctly guessing that Natalie had made the offer from the Edge. Prior to the season, Tyson, Rob, Jeremy, and Kim had played in a televised Poker tournament with Tyson casually suggesting an alliance if the four of them were to play Survivor again. Kim and Amber felt the early pace of the game was overwhelming, with Kim shocked to find herself being actively left out of strategic talk by the majority of Dakal. At Tribal Council, all three tried to convince the tribe that there was no Poker Alliance in the game, with Amber and Kim trying to convince others to take out Nick for being the most recent winner. It was to no avail, with the disconnected players and the Game Changers trio sending Amber to the Edge fearing her natural alliance with her husband Rob at Sele.

Later in the day, Ben worked on his social game by showing Denise how to look for an idol, which she eventually found. However, the idol was split into two halves. She had to give one half to tribemate before sundown. After choosing Adam to discuss tactics with, he convinced her not to share the idol with her suggestion, Parvati, but with Adam instead.\nAt Dakal, Kim still felt she was on the bottom of the tribe and went on an idol hunt of her own. She found the Dakal split idol and revealed it to Sophie as an attempt to gain trust with a person in the majority. Despite a rocky first season playing together in Cagayan, Sarah and Tony sought to use their six-year friendship to solidify a true trustworthy \"Cops-R-Us\" alliance.\nOn the Edge of Extinction, a new advantage clue had Amber and Natalie searching high and low throughout the island. After giving up for the day, Natalie discovered a \"safety without power\" advantage hidden inside the water well. The advantage allowed a player to leave Tribal Council and return to camp before the votes are cast to protect his or herself. Natalie chose to sell it to Jeremy for a fire token. He accepted the deal, guessing that it came from Natalie and realizing that the Sele tribe wasn't fully aware of the potential of the fire tokens.\n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: The tribes pushed a large wagon across an obstacle course, retrieved three keys from tall posts to unlock three heavy trunks with puzzle pieces inside, and put the trunks on the wagon. After loading  all three trunks on the wagon, the tribes disassembled the wagon and pushed the wagon and trunks either through or over a fence. They then climbed over the fence themselves. They then re-assembled the wagon, put the trunks back on board, and dragged the wagon through more obstacles. Once at the finish, two tribe members used the pieces to assemble a vertical circular puzzle. The first tribe to finish wins a spice kit and immunity. Draggin' the Dragon challenge from Cagayan and Cambodia.After seeing that his wife had been voted out, Rob fumbled in the puzzle portion of the challenge, leading to Sele's blowout loss. Since old school players were at a numerical disadvantage, Parvati and Rob wanted to target new school players, primarily Jeremy or Ben as outsiders. Danni felt vulnerable as her alliances and Parvati were leaving her out of conversations. Danni revealed to Ben, in front of Ethan, that there was an old school alliance in her attempts to plead her case. Ben suggested Danni as the best to vote out due to her scrambling, while Danni started to pitch a Parvati vote to Rob. Jeremy and Michele tried to recruit Adam to join in the plan.\nAt Tribal Council, the Sele tribe spoke about the rapid pace of the game and that the old school players were struggling to keep up. Parvati spoke about an old school and new school divide, and Ben revealed Danni's slip-up earlier in the day as an example of Sele's paranoia. The resulting paranoia amongst Sele led Rob to ask the entire tribe to dump their bags and expose if they had an idol. Denise and Adam kept their idol halves hidden from the view of their tribemates while the rest of Sele revealed the contents of their bags. After a flurry of whispering among players, the entire tribe voted out Danni for her scrambling.

At Dakal, the tribe continued to flourish thanks to Sandra netting a shark. Despite this, Tyson worked to gather numbers against Sandra in an attempt to get back on the plus side of the numbers. Yul had mixed feelings and ultimately told Sandra about Tyson's plot. The three players on the Edge had a chance for a fire token; Natalie deciphered the clue and found a paper stating there was a \"vote steal advantage\" hidden in an opposing tribe member's torch; she anonymously offered the advantage to Sarah on Dakal. After accepting the offer, Sarah had Tony camouflage her and she was able to retrieve the \"vote steal\" from Sele's torches.\n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: Castaways jumped between three sets of raised ramps, having to re-start if they fell. Tribes then dug a heavy ladder out of a sand pit, propped it upright so that one member could retrieve a monkey's fist on top of a tripod. They tossed the monkey's fist through a target in order to climb the first ramp of a tall tower. Afterwards, tribemates used their bodies to hoist each other to the top of a second ramp. Once at the top, two members solved a tree puzzle. The first tribe to finish their puzzle won immunity as well as chicken kebabs and a grill. Along the Watchtower challenge from Ghost Island.Dakal edged out Sele for the victory. At camp, Adam, despite being in the majority with the new schoolers, attempted to get Denise, Ethan, and then Rob on board with voting out Parvati, to Rob's confusion and frustration. Jeremy was also wary of Adam and wanted to vote him out, but Michele had misgivings -- she insisted that despite Adam's duplicity they should preserve the new schoolers' numbers, suggesting an alternative strategy of weakening Rob and Parvati by blindsiding their close ally Ethan.

On Dakal, morale was high thanks to the tribe's winning streak, but Tyson suspected that Yul had been leading an alliance of one-time winners against the people with connections. Tyson tried to warn Sandra and Tony to no avail as Sandra was still angry that Tyson threw her name around days ago. However, Sarah felt that keeping Tyson around was a good move for her since she had bonded with him. On the Edge, the four inhabitants were given a task to carry twenty logs, one at a time, from the top of the mountain back down to camp before sundown. They all struggled mightily, with Ethan almost fainting and requiring medical intervention near the end point, but all four completed the task and earned a fire token each.\n\nReward/Immunity Challenge: Three tribe members sat in a boat to which the other four members are tethered as swimmers. The swimmers towed the boat to a tower, where three sets of keys are to be collected. The tribes then headed to a platform, where they used the keys to unlock puzzle pieces. Two members of each tribe then used the pieces to solve a block puzzle. The first tribe to do so won immunity as well as four egg-laying chickens.

Back at Dakal, Tyson targeted Nick for struggling on the puzzle as it was the same one he succeeded on back in David vs. Goliath. The rest of the tribe considered voting out Tyson. However, Tony wanted to assemble a group of big threats including Sarah, Kim, and Sandra to keep Tyson as shields for themselves. Although Sarah and Kim were on board, Sandra had doubts as she felt Tyson was too dangerous. At Tribal Council, Tyson voted for Nick, who voted for Kim on the chance Tyson had an idol.

On Sele, Michele and Wendell, who previously dated, awkwardly reunited; she and Parvati agreed to target Wendell if it benefited their game.

Wendell and Michele's history saw the two struggle to make a plan when Michele told Wendell that she was considering voting for him so Parvati would bequeath her fire tokens to her. Wendell tried to sell his vote to Parvati for her fire tokens, but she chose to use that information to recruit Nick into making a big move. The vote sale was brought up in Tribal Council when Parvati tried to highlight Wendell's potential to betray Nick and Yul, but the men stuck together to send Parvati to the edge, voiding her idol nullifier.

At Tribal Council, Jeremy tried to explain that it would be pointless to stick to original tribal lines, but remained nervous with Denise about the original Dakal trio's intentions. When Jeff asked the tribe if anyone wanted to play an idol, Denise stepped up and played Sandra's idol on herself.

At the Edge, Natalie continued her dominance at finding advantages; this new one would be sold to a castaway in order to give another competitor a disadvantage at the upcoming immunity challenge. She sold this to Nick for 8 tokens, and since he had only 6, he asked Michele to loan him the remaining two.\n\nImmunity Challenge: Castaways must place blocks in a straight line while avoiding trip wires that leave for less space the farther down they are. They then must push a block so they all fall like dominoes and land on a gong. The first to do so won immunity and two fire tokens.

As it was the last day to use fire tokens, Denise proposed everyone eat the rest of the rice so she could buy more and be more prepared for the second re-entry challenge if she were to get voted out. Ben and Denise had targeted Nick, while Michele and Nick targeted Denise. Tony's spy nest allowed him to listen in on Denise forming a final three with Sarah and Ben, which made him talk to Sarah about possibly voting out Denise instead. However, at Tribal Council, he and Sarah joined Denise and Ben in sending Nick to the Edge.\nOn Day 35, both groups were informed that the second and final re-entry challenge would take place today, and the group from the Edge prepared accordingly.

Natalie reconnected with Michele, who was on the outside of the foursome containing Tony, Sarah, Ben, and Denise. Natalie informed Michele that she had an idol and vowed to use it to further both of their interests. She also told the remaining castaways that the jury was convinced Tony would win if he made it to the end in an attempt to shake up their alliance. This frustrated Sarah, who felt she wasn't receiving credit for making the same moves as Tony because she was a woman. \n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways must race through an obstacle course and a giant water slide to retrieve three sandbags one at a time.

Sarah switched her vote to Ben at Tribal Council, sending him to the jury over Michele after Natalie's irrelevant idol play on herself.\n\nImmunity Challenge: The castaways, with one hand tied behind their back, must drop a ball into a metal chute, which travels down a spiraling metal track. A turnstile gate in the middle of the track rotates with every ball, causing the ball to alternate exiting out of the two exits. The castaways must catch the ball and drop it back into the chute at the top. Every few minutes, an additional ball is added to the track until up to seven balls are active on the track. If a ball exits the track and is not caught, the castaway is eliminated; the last one remaining won immunity. \"Simmotion\" challenge from Tocantins, Cambodia and David vs. Goliath.Natalie won the final immunity challenge. Tony, Michele, and Sarah all practiced fire that afternoon as Natalie contemplated her decision. At Tribal Council, Natalie elected to take Michele with her to the Final 3 and force Tony and Sarah to make fire. Despite an early lead by Sarah, Tony came back and won the challenge, making Sarah the final member of the jury.\nAt the Final Tribal Council, all three finalists highlighted their unique journeys to the end: Tony's dominant strategic play, Michele's underdog story playing from the bottom, and Natalie's resilience on the Edge and hard work earning advantages. The jurors agreed that Natalie dominated the Edge of Extinction portion of the game, but felt Tony had a much stronger social and strategic game.

Erika found the advantage, which gave her an advantage in the next immunity challenge.\n\nImmunity/Reward Challenge: Castaways must use a long pole to knock strands of rope off of a bamboo lattice. They must then use said ropes to construct two sets of rope ladders, climb the ladders and solve a 75-piece puzzle. The first castaway to finish the puzzle won immunity and a food reward.Erika won the challenge, thanks to her advantage that allowed her to start with both of her ladders already partially completed. She was permitted to take one player with her on the food reward; she chose Heather. The consensus was that Ricard was too dangerous to keep in the game, but Xander considered playing his idol for Ricard to make a big move for the jury. However, he elected to play it for himself, and Ricard was unanimously voted out.\n\nImmunity Challenge: Castaways balanced on a curved platform, holding a rope that stabilized a small ledge in front of them. They must assemble a six-piece block tower atop the ledge, moving one block at a time across the platform. The first castaway to complete their block tower and return to the starting position without it falling won immunity.Xander won the challenge, and the other castaways made their pitches to him for Tribal Council. Deshawn and Heather both stressed that Erika was the biggest threat left in the game, while Erika downplayed her threat level. Xander believed Erika was a strong firemaker and did not want her to get the opportunity to win the firemaking challenge, so he elected to take her to Final 3 with him. Deshawn and Heather competed in the firemaking challenge; Heather had a strong flame early that faltered, allowing Deshawn time to build his own flame and burn through the rope, advancing to the Final 3 seconds before Heather’s own rope burned. Heather became the final member of the jury.\nAt the Final Tribal Council, jurors questioned Xander’s social awareness; he was criticized for misreading the jury’s perception of Erika and underestimating her gameplay by giving her a free pass to the end. Deshawn’s emotional decision-making was also criticized, with Shan and others lamenting his decision to break up their alliance too early. The final jury vote was 7–1–0, with Danny voting for Deshawn and everyone else voting for Erika, awarding her the $1 million and the title of Sole Survivor.\nImmediately after the final vote reading, the jury and the finalists discuss the season with host Jeff Probst in the \"Survivor After Show\"."},{"version":"US","version_season":"US42","season":42,"episode_number_overall":571,"episode":1,"episode_title":"Feels Like a Rollercoaster","episode_label":"Ep 1","episode_date":"2022-03-09","episode_length":86,"viewers":4960000,"imdb_rating":7.4,"n_ratings":225,"episode_summary":"Jeff welcomed the 18 new castaways before announcing their first reward challenge.\n\nReward Challenge: One member from each tribe raced into the jungle to untie two paddles. A second member then raced along the beach to retrieve the rest of the paddles, but each were met with a decision to either grab the paddles immediately, or untie 20 knots for individual advantages. Once all paddles were obtained, tribes rowed around a buoy before collecting bamboo sticks which would be used to retrieve a flint. The first tribe to get the flint won it plus a pot and a machete.Daniel injured his shoulder but was cleared to continue after the challenge concluded. Drea, Hai, and Lindsay agreed on taking the secret advantage, and Taku’s large lead going into the final stage was squandered to Ika. Taku and Vati were met with a “savvy” or “sweat” task to complete in four hours to obtain basic supplies. Both chose “savvy” and successfully completed a puzzle in which they had to count how many triangles were within a large triangle. Drea, Hai, and Lindsay learned they each possessed an \"advantage amulet,\" which gave the trio one extra vote among the three of them. If only two of those castaways remained in the game, the advantage would upgrade to a steal-a-vote. If only one of those castaways remained, the amulet would become a full idol. This advantage would be good until the Final Six.\nAt Ika, two alliances of three (Drea-Rocksroy-Romeo and Swati-Tori-Zach) formed, but some tribemates were put off by Rocksroy’s method of leadership when building the shelter. Tori went off on her own to gather food for the tribe, but some saw this as her looking for an idol. At Vati, bonds between Jenny & Mike and Hai & Lydia led Chanelle to propose an alliance with Daniel. At Taku, Jackson opened up to his tribemates about being a transgender man.\nOn Day Two, one representative from each tribe went to a summit: Maryanne from Taku, Jenny from Vati, and Drea from Ika bonded on their journey before deciding to risk or protect their vote. Jenny protected hers, while Drea and Maryanne risked, meaning they each received an extra vote. On the morning of Day Three, Jeff arrived at Taku to talk about Jackson's underlying medical condition which required the use of lithium, something about which Jackson did not tell production in advance. The worry of lithium withdrawal, which could have caused side effects, prompted his removal from the game.[9]\nImmunity Challenge: Tribes swam to a boat where they gathered three heavy chests floating in the water, which they pushed under nets after arriving on land. Two tribe members used puzzle pieces inside the chest to assemble a giant dragon puzzle.

Taku was tasked to send one member from Vati and one from either their own tribe or Ika to the summit; they chose Chanelle and Omar. Though Chanelle expressed the importance of her vote to Omar, she decided to risk her vote, as did he. Jenny and Mike targeted Lydia, while Hai and Lydia targeted Jenny. Chanelle telling Daniel she risked her vote led to some scrambling before Tribal Council, during which Mike and Chanelle could not vote (due respectively to the Beware idol and to unsuccessfully risking the vote). Daniel voted against Lydia to force a 2–2 tie, which was deadlocked after neither Hai nor Daniel switched their vote.

Other tribe members pointed out Jonathan's dominance in recent challenges. Back at camp, Maryanne and Omar voiced frustration with Jonathan's comment about their tribe being a \"tight four\". Jonathan noted that he could be a shield for others moving forward. \nAt Ika, the tribe was irritated with Rocksroy's bossiness around camp. Due to Drea's extra vote, Swati approached Tori with a plan to bring in Rocksroy. Tori mentioned Drea's extra vote to Rocksroy, who relayed the conversation to Drea. Once it got back to Swati, she became frustrated with her ally for sharing too much information.\n\nImmunity Challenge: Two members from each tribe were tethered to a boat, and hauled the remaining members in the boat through the water to a platform.

At Tribal Council, Rachel played her idol to block Sam’s vote, and Sue joined her in sending Andy to the jury (to the visible delight of the jury members).\nRachel and Genevieve were set to go head to head as the biggest targets, causing the remaining three to feel as if they were being written off prematurely.\n\nImmunity Challenge: Contestants sprinted up from the ocean to the beach where they had to dig through a wall of sand under an obstacle.

After retrieving all three chests, three tribe members climbed a steep slide to the top of a platform. Using a pole, they knocked off a key ring used to open the chest.

Saiounia felt uneasy about Mary’s behavior and tried to convince Cedrek to split the vote on Justin; both Cedrek and Justin argued that Mary was bluffing, which Mary played up when Saiounia directly confronted her. At Tribal Council, Mary played her Shot in the Dark and successfully negated the two votes against her. On the revote, Saiounia voted Justin while Cedrek voted Saiounia; neither changed their vote on the second revote, leading to a deadlock.

Once everyone was at the end, two players unlocked and solved a survivor turtle puzzle. The first two tribes to finish won immunity.Hina and Uli won yet again. MC and Rizo found Hina and Uli's respective beware advantages. Sophi and Jeremiah plotted to blindside Alex by making him feel comfortable enough to not play his idol, but when Sophi overheard Alex tell Jeremiah he was considering voting Sophi to save himself, Sophi considered voting Jeremiah instead.
