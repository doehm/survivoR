\description{
A dataset containing the count of confessionals per castaway per episode. A confessional is when
the castaway is speaking directly to the camera about their game.
}
\details{
Confessional data has been counted by contributors of the survivoR R package and consolidated
with external sources. The aim is to establish consistency in confessional counts in the absence of official
sources. Given the subjective nature of the counts and the potential for clerical error no single source is
more valid than another. Therefore, it is reasonable to average across all sources.

In the case of double or extended episodes, if the episode only has one title it is considered a single episode. This
means the average number of confessionals per person is likely to be higher for this episode given it's length. If
there are two episode titles the confessionals are counted for the appropriate episode. This is to ensure consistency
across all other datasets.

In the case of recap episodes, this episode is left blank.

The indexes are a measure of how many more confessional counts or time the castaway has received given the point in the game.
For example a \code{index_count} of 1 implies the castaway has received the expected number of confessionals given equal share within tribe.
An index of 1.5 implies have have received 50\% more. The measure is standardised within tribe since the tribe that goes to tribal
typically receives more confessionals for the episode. Makes sense. \code{index_time} is the same but using time instead of counts.

If you also count confessionals, please get in touch and I'll add them into the package.
