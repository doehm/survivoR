\details{
Each item has been categorised into 5 main categories:
1. Food and drink: The most common item. It may be simply food or drink, not necessarily both.
2. Comfort: Things like a shower, toothpaste, etc
3. Letters from home
4. Advantage: Could be a clue to a hidden immunity idol, advantage in the next challenge, or in the current auction
5. Bad item: The not good item, typically one of the covered items. Whether or not it's actually bad is subjective, but where someone
is hoping for pizza and gets bat soup I consider it a bad item.
