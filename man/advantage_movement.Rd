This data frame contains the following columns:
\describe{
\item{\code{version}}{Country code for the version of the show}
\item{\code{version_season}}{Version season key}
\item{\code{season}}{The season number}
\item{\code{castaway}}{Name of the castaway involved in the event e.g. found, played, received, etc.}
\item{\code{castaway_id}}{ID of the castaway (primary key). Consistent across seasons and name changes e.g. Amber Brkich / Amber Mariano. The first two letters reference the country of the version played e.g. US, AU.}
\item{\code{advantage_id}}{The ID / primary key of the advantage}
\item{\code{sequence_id}}{The sequence of events. For example \code{sequence_id == 1} usually means the advantage was found. Each subsequent event follows the \code{sequence_id}}
\item{\code{day}}{The day the event occurred}
\item{\code{episode}}{The episode the event occurred}
\item{\code{event}}{The event e.g. the advantage was found, played, received, etc}
\item{\code{played_for}}{If the advantage or idol was played this records who it was played for}
\item{\code{played_for_id}}{the ID for who the advantage or idol was played for}
\item{\code{success}}{If the play was successful or not. Only relevant for advantages since playing a hidden immunity idol is always successful in terms of saving who it was played for.}
\item{\code{votes_nullified}}{In the case of hidden immunity idols this is the count of how many votes were nullified when played}
\item{\code{sog_id}}{Stage of game ID for joining to \code{vote_history} and \code{challenge_results}}

\description{

it records who received it. The logical flow is identified by the \code{sequence_id}.
