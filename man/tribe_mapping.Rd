\description{
A mapping for castaways to tribes for each day (day being the day of the tribal council)
This is useful for observing who is on what tribe throughout the game.
}
\details{
Each season by episode and day holds a complete list of castaways still in the game and
which tribe they are on. Moving through each day you can observe the changes in
the tribe. For example the first day has all castaways mapped to their
original tribe. The next day has the same minus the castaway just voted out. This
is useful for observing the changes in tribe make either due to castaways being voted
off the island, tribe swaps, who is on Redemption Island and Edge of Extinction.
