\title{Challenge Summary}
\format{
This data frame contains the following columns
\describe{
  \item{\code{category}}{The category of the challenge e.g. tribal, individual, individual immunity, duel, etc. This makes it easy
  to split out the difference types of challenges and avoid complications such as 'Team / Individual' challenges where there is a
  dependent outcome structure. Join to \code{challenge_results} using \code{challenge_id}, \code{version_season} and \code{castaway_id}}
  \item{\code{version_season}}{Version season key}
  \item{\code{challenge_id}}{Primary key to the \code{challenge_description} data set which contains features of the challenge}
  \item{\code{challenge_type}}{The challenge type e.g. immunity, reward, etc}
  \item{\code{outcome_type}}{Whether the challenge is individual or tribal. Some individual reward challenges may involve multiple castaways as the winner gets to choose who they bring along}
  \item{\code{tribe}}{Current tribe the castaway is on}
  \item{\code{castaway}}{Name of castaway. Generally this is the name they were most commonly referred to
  or nickname e.g. no one called Coach, Benjamin. He was simply Coach}
  \item{\code{castaway_id}}{ID of the castaway (primary key). Consistent across seasons and name changes e.g. Amber Brkich / Amber Mariano. The first two letters reference the country of the version played e.g. US, AU (TBA).}
  \item{\code{n_entities}}{Number of entities competing for the win e.g. the number of tribes, teams, or people.}
  \item{\code{n_winners}}{Number of winners (or winning entities) e.g. if there are two tribes there is only one winning tribe, if there
  are three tribes like the new era there are two winning tribes and one that goes to tribal council.}
  \item{\code{won}}{If the castaway won}
